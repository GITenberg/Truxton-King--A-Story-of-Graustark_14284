<h3>TRUXTON KING</h3>


<p>He was a tall, rawboned, rangy young fellow with a
face so tanned by wind and sun you had the impression
that his skin would feel like leather if you could affect
the impertinence to test it by the sense of touch. Not
that you would like to encourage this bit of impudence
after a look into his devil-may-care eyes; but you might
easily imagine something much stronger than brown
wrapping paper and not quite so passive as burnt clay.
His clothes fit him loosely and yet were graciously devoid
of the bagginess which characterises the appearance
of extremely young men whose frames are not fully
set and whose joints are still parading through the last
stages of college development. This fellow, you could
tell by looking at him, had been out of college from two
to five years; you could also tell, beyond doubt or contradiction,
that he had been in college for his full allotted
time and had not escaped the usual number of &quot;conditions&quot;
that dismay but do not discourage the happy-go-lucky
undergraduate who makes two or three teams with
comparative ease, but who has a great deal of difficulty
with physics or whatever else he actually is supposed to
acquire between the close of the football season and the
opening of baseball practice.</p>

<p>This tall young man in the panama hat and grey flannels
was Truxton King, embryo globe-trotter and
searcher after the treasures of Romance. Somewhere
up near Central Park, in one of the fashionable cross
streets, was the home of his father and his father's father
before him: a home which Truxton had not seen in two
years or more. It is worthy of passing notice, and that
is all, that his father was a manufacturer; more than
that, he was something of a power in the financial world.
His mother was not strictly a social queen in the great
metropolis, but she was what we might safely call one
of the first &quot;ladies in waiting.&quot; Which is quite good
enough for the wife of a manufacturer; especially when
one records that her husband was a manufacturer of
steel. It is also a matter of no little consequence that
Truxton's mother was more or less averse to the steel
business as a heritage for her son. Be it understood,
here and now, that she intended Truxton for the diplomatic
service: as far removed from sordid steel as the
New York post office is from the Court of St. James.</p>

<p>But neither Truxton's father, who wanted him to be a
manufacturing Croesus, or Truxton's mother, who expected
him to become a social Solomon, appears to have
taken the young man's private inclinations into consideration.
Truxton preferred a life of adventure distinctly
separated from steel and velvet; nor was he slow
to set his esteemed parents straight in this respect. He
had made up his mind to travel, to see the world, to be a
part of the big round globe on which we, as ordinary
individuals with no personality beyond the next block,
are content to sit and encourage the single ambition to
go to Europe at least once, so that we may not be left
out of the general conversation.</p>

<p>Young Mr. King believed in Romance. He had believed
in Santa Claus and the fairies, and he grew up
with an ever increasing bump of imagination, contiguous
to which, strange to relate, there was a properly
developed bump of industry and application. Hence, it is
not surprising that he was willing to go far afield in
search of the things that seemed more or less worth while
to a young gentleman who had suffered the ill-fortune
to be born in the nineteenth century instead of the seventeenth.
Romance and adventure, politely amorous but
vigorously attractive, came up to him from the seventeenth
century, perhaps through the blood of some
swash-buckling ancestor, and he was held enthralled by
the possibilities that lay hidden in some far off or even
nearby corner of this hopelessly unromantic world of
the twentieth century.</p>

<p>To be sure there was war, but war isn't Romance. Besides,
he was too young to fight against Spain; and,
later on, he happened to be more interested in football
than he was in the Japs or the Russians. The only thing
left for him to do was to set forth in quest of adventure;
adventure was not likely to apply to him in Fifth Avenue
or at the factory or&mdash;still, there was a certain kind
of adventure analogous to Broadway, after all. He
thought it over and, after trying it for a year or two,
decided that Broadway and the Tenderloin did not produce
the sort of Romance he could cherish for long as
a self-respecting hero, so he put certain small temptations
aside, chastened himself as well as he could, and
set out for less amiable but more productive by-ways
in other sections of the globe.</p>

<p>We come upon him at last&mdash;luckily for us we were not
actually following him&mdash;after two years of wonderful
but rather disillusioning adventure in mid-Asia and all
Africa. He had seen the Congo and the Euphrates, the
Ganges and the Nile, the Yang-tse-kiang and the
Yenisei; he had climbed mountains in Abyssinia, in
Siam, in Thibet and Afghanistan; he had shot big game
in more than one jungle, and had been shot at by small
brown men in more than one forest, to say nothing of the
little encounters he had had in most un-Occidental towns
and cities. He had seen women in Morocco and Egypt
and Persia and&mdash;But it is a waste of time to enumerate.
Strange to say, he was now drifting back toward the
civilisation which we are pleased to call our own, with a
sense of genuine disappointment in his heart. He had
found no sign of Romance.</p>

<p>Adventure in plenty, but Romance&mdash;ah, the fairy
princesses were in the story books, after all.</p>

<p>Here he was, twenty-six years old, strong and full of the
fire of life, convincing himself that there was nothing for
him to do but to drift back to dear old New York and
talk to his father about going into the offices; to let
his mother tell him over and over again of the nice girls
she knew who did not have to be rescued from ogres and
all that sort of thing in order to settle down to domestic
obsolescence; to tell his sister and all of their mutual
friends the whole truth and nothing but the truth concerning
his adventures in the wilds, and to feel that the
friends, at least, were predestined to look upon him as a
fearless liar, nothing more.</p>

<p>For twenty days he had travelled by caravan across the
Persian uplands, through Herat, and Meshed and
Bokhara, striking off with his guide alone toward the
Sea of Aral and the eastern shores of the Caspian,
thence through the Ural foothills to the old Roman highway
that led down into the sweet green valleys of a land
he had thought of as nothing more than the creation of
a hairbrained fictionist.</p>

<p>Somewhere out in the shimmering east he had learned,
to his honest amazement, that there was such a land as
Graustark. At first he would not believe. But the English
bank in Meshed assured him that he would come to
it if he travelled long enough and far enough into the
north and west and if he were not afraid of the hardships
that most men abhor. The dying spirit of Romance
flamed up in his heart; his blood grew quick again
and eager. He would not go home until he had sought
out this land of fair women and sweet tradition. And
so he traversed the wild and dangerous Tartar roads for
days and days, like the knights of Scheherazade in the
times of old, and came at last to the gates of Edelweiss.</p>

<p>Not until he sat down to a rare dinner in the historic
Hotel Regengetz was he able to realise that he was truly
in that fabled, mythical land of Graustark, quaint, grim
little principality in the most secret pocket of the earth's
great mantle. This was the land of his dreams, the land
of his fancy; he had not even dared to hope that it
actually existed.</p>

<p>And now, here he was, pinching himself to prove that
he was awake, stretching his world-worn bones under a
dainty table to which real food was being brought by&mdash;well,
he was obliged to pinch himself again. From the
broad terrace after dinner he looked out into the streets
of the quaint, picture-book town with its medi&aelig;val simplicity
and ruggedness combined; his eyes tried to keep
pace with the things that his fertile brain was seeing
beyond the glimmering lights and dancing window
panes&mdash;for the whole scene danced before him with a
persistent unreality that made him feel his own pulse in
the fear that some sudden, insidious fever had seized
upon him.</p>

<p>If any one had told him, six months before, that there
was such a land as Graustark and that if he could but
keep on travelling in a certain direction he would come
to it in time, he would have laughed that person to
scorn, no matter how precise a geographer he might have
been.</p>

<p>Young Mr. King, notwithstanding his naturally reckless
devotion to first impressions, was a much wiser person
than when he left his New York home two years before.
Roughing it in the wildest parts of the world
had taught him that eagerness is the enemy of common
sense. Therefore he curbed the thrilling impulse to fare
forth in search of diversion on this first night; he conquered
himself and went to bed early&mdash;and to sleep at
once, if that may serve to assist you in getting an idea
of what time and circumstances had done for his character.</p>

<p>A certain hard-earned philosophy had convinced him
long ago that adventure is quite content to wait over
from day to day, but that when a man is tired and worn
it isn't quite sensible to expect sleep to be put off regardless.
With a fine sense of sacrifice, therefore, he went to
bed, forsaking the desire to tread the dim streets of a
city by night in advance of a more cautious survey by
daylight. He had come to know that it is best to make
sure of your ground, in a measure, at least, before taking
too much for granted&mdash;to look before you leap, so
to speak. And so, his mind tingling with visions of fair
ladies and goodly opportunities, he went to sleep&mdash;and
did not get up to breakfast until noon the next day.</p>

<p>And now it becomes my deplorable duty to divulge the
fact that Truxton King, after two full days and nights
in the city of Edelweiss, was quite ready to pass on to
other fields, completely disillusionised in his own mind,
and not a little disgusted with himself for having gone
to the trouble to visit the place. To his intense chagrin,
he had found the quaint old city very tiresome. True,
it was a wonderful old town, rich in tradition, picturesque
in character, hoary with age, bulging with the
secrets of an active past; but at present, according to
the well travelled Truxton, it was a poky old place about
which historians either had lied gloriously or had been
taken in shamelessly. In either case, Edelweiss was not
what he had come to believe it would be. He had travelled
overland for nearly a month, out of the heart of
Asia, to find himself, after all, in a graveyard of great
expectations!</p>

<p>He had explored Edelweiss, the capital. He had ridden
about the ramparts; he had taken snapshots of the fortress
down the river and had not been molested; he had
gone mule-back up the mountain to the snowcapped
monastery of St. Valentine, overtopping and overlooking
the green valleys below; he had seen the tower in
which illustrious prisoners were reported to have been
held; he had ridden over the King's Road to Ganlook
and had stood on American bridges at midnight&mdash;all the
while wondering why he was there. Moreover, he had
traversed the narrow, winding streets of the city by day
and night; never, in all his travels, had he encountered a
more peaceful, less spirit-stirring place or populace.</p>

<p>Everybody was busy, and thrifty, and law abiding.
He might just as well have gone to Prague or Nuremburg;
either was as old and as quaint and as stupid
as this lukewarm city in the hills.</p>

<p>Where were the beautiful women he had read about and
dreamed of ever since he left Teheran? On his soul, he
had not seen half a dozen women in Edelweiss who were
more than passably fair to look upon. True, he had to
admit, the people he had seen were of the lower and
middle classes&mdash;the shopkeepers and the shopgirls, the
hucksters and the fruit vendors. What he wanted to
know was this: What had become of the royalty and
the nobility of Graustark? Where were the princes, the
dukes and the barons, to say nothing of the feminine
concomitants to these excellent gentlemen?</p>

<p>What irritated him most of all was the amazing discovery
that there was a Cook's tourist office in town and
that no end of parties arrived and departed under his
very nose, all mildly exhilarated over the fact that they
had seen Graustark! The interpreter, with &quot;Cook's&quot; on
his cap, was quite the most important, if quite the least
impressive personage in town. It is no wonder that this
experienced globe-trotter was disgusted!</p>

<p>There was a train to Vienna three times a week. He
made up his mind that he would not let the Saturday
express go down without him. He had done some
emphatic sputtering because he had neglected to take
the one on Thursday.</p>

<p>Shunning the newly discovered American club in Castle
Avenue as if it were a pest house, he lugubriously wandered
the streets alone, painfully conscious that the
citizens, instead of staring at him with admiring eyes,
were taking but little notice of him. Tall young Americans
were quite common in Edelweiss in these days.</p>

<p>One dingy little shop in the square interested him. It
was directly opposite the Royal Caf&eacute; (with American
bar attached), and the contents of its grimy little windows
presented a peculiarly fascinating interest to him.
Time and again, he crossed over from the Caf&eacute; garden to
look into these windows. They were packed with weapons
and firearms of such ancient design that he wondered
what they could have been used for, even in the Middle
Ages. Once he ventured inside the little shop. Finding
no attendant, he put aside his suddenly formed impulse
to purchase a mighty broadsword. From somewhere in
the rear of the building came the clanging of steel hammers,
the ringing of highly tempered metals; but, although
he pounded vigorously with his cane, no one came
forth to attend him.</p>

<p>On several occasions he had seen a grim, sharp-featured
old man in the doorway of the shop, but it was not until
after he had missed the Thursday train that he made up
his mind to accost him and to have the broadsword at
any price. With this object in view, he quickly crossed
the square and inserted his tall frame into the narrow
doorway, calling out lustily for attention. So loudly
did he shout that the multitude of ancient swords and
guns along the walls seemed to rattle in terror at this
sudden encroachment of the present.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; demanded a sharp, angry voice at his
elbow. He wheeled and found himself looking into the
wizened, parchment-like face of the little old man, whose
black eyes snapped viciously. &quot;Do you think I am
deaf?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know you were here,&quot; gasped Truxton, forgetting
to be surprised by the other's English. &quot;The
place looked empty. Excuse me for yelling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That broad&mdash;Say, you speak English, don't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; snapped the old man. &quot;Why shouldn't I?
I can't afford an interpreter. You'll find plenty of
English used here in Edelweiss since the Americans and
British came. They won't learn our language, so we
must learn theirs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak it quite as well as I do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better, young man. You are an American.&quot; The
sarcasm was not lost on Truxton King, but he was not
inclined to resent it. A twinkle had come into the eyes
of the ancient; the deep lines about his lips seemed
almost ready to crack into a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the price of that old sword you have in the
window?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you wish to purchase it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three hundred gavvos.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that in dollars?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Four hundred and twenty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whew!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is genuine, sir, and three hundred years old. Old
Prince Boris carried it. It's most rare. Ten years ago
you might have had it for fifty gavvos. But,&quot; with a
shrug of his thin shoulders, &quot;the price of antiquities has
gone up materially since the Americans began to come.
They don't want a thing if it is cheap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you a hundred dollars for it, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;&quot; he
looked at the sign on the open door&mdash;&quot;Mr. Spantz.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good day, sir.&quot; The old man was bowing him out of
the shop. King was amused.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's talk it over. What's the least you'll take in real
money?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want your money. Good day.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton King felt his chin in perplexity. In all his
travels he had found no other merchant whom he could
not &quot;beat down&quot; two or three hundred per cent. on an
article.</p>

<p>&quot;It's too much. I can't afford it,&quot; he said, disappointment
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I have modern blades of my own make, sir, much
cheaper and quite as good,&quot; ventured the excellent Mr.
Spantz.</p>

<p>&quot;You make 'em?&quot; in surprise.</p>

<p>The old man straightened his bent figure with sudden
pride. &quot;I am armourer to the crown, sir. My blades are
used by the nobility&mdash;not by the army, I am happy to
say. Spantz repairs the swords and guns for the army,
but he welds only for the gentlemen at court.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Tradition, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My great-grandfather wrought blades for the princes
a hundred years ago. My son will make them after I
am gone, and his son after him. I, sir, have made the
wonderful blade with the golden hilt and scabbard which
the little Prince carries on days of state. It was two
years in the making. There is no other blade so fine.
It is so short that you would laugh at it as a weapon,
and yet you could bend it double. Ah, there was a
splendid piece of work, sir. You should see the little
toy to appreciate it. There are diamonds and rubies
worth 50,000 gavvos set in the handle. Ah, it is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton's eyes were sparkling once more. Somehow
he was amused by the sudden garrulousness of the old
armourer. He held up his hand to check the flow of
words.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Herr Spantz, or Monsieur, perhaps, you are the
first man I've met who has volunteered to go into rhapsodies
for my benefit. I'd like to have a good long chat
with you. What do you say to a mug of that excellent
beer over in the Caf&eacute; garden? Business seems to be a
little dull. Can't you&mdash;er&mdash;lock up?&quot;</p>

<p>Spantz looked at him keenly under his bushy brows, his
little black eyes fairly boring holes into King's brain, so
to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask what brings you to Edelweiss?&quot; he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mind telling you, Mr. Spantz, that I'm here
because I'm somewhat of a fool. False hopes led me
astray. I thought Graustark was the home, the genesis
of Romance, and I'm more or less like that chap we've
read about, who was always in search of adventure.
Somehow, Graustark hasn't come up to expectations.
Up to date, this is the slowest burg I've ever seen. I'm
leaving next Saturday for Vienna.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; cackled Spantz, his eyes twinkling with mirth.
&quot;You thought you could capture wild and beautiful
princesses here just as you pleased, eh? Let me tell you,
young man, only one American&mdash;only one foreigner, in
fact&mdash;has accomplished that miracle. Mr. Lorry came
here ten years ago and won the fairest flower Graustark
ever produced-the beautiful Yetive&mdash;but he was the
only one. I suppose you are surprised to find Graustark
a solid, prosperous, God-fearing little country, whose
people are wise and happy and loyal. You have learned,
by this time, that we have no princesses for you to protect.
It isn't as it was when Mr. Lorry came and found
Her Serene Highness in medi&aelig;val difficulties. There is
a prince on the throne to-day&mdash;you've seen him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I'm not looking for princes. I've seen hundreds
of 'em in all parts of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you should see Prince Robin before you scoff.
He's the most wonderful little man in all the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard of nothing but him, my good Mr. Spantz.
He's seven years old and he looks like his mother and he's
got a jewelled sword and all that sort of thing. I daresay
he's a nice little chap. Got American blood in him,
you see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not let any one hear you laugh about him, sir.
The people worship him. If you laugh too publicly, you
may have your hands full of adventures in a very few
minutes&mdash;and your body full of fine steel blades. We
are very proud of our Prince.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Mr. Spantz. I didn't mean <i>les&eacute;
majest&eacute;</i>. I'm bored, that's all. You wouldn't blame me
for being sore if you'd come as far as I have and got as
little for your pains. Why, hang it all, this morning
that confounded man from Cook's had a party of twenty-two
American school-teachers and Bible students in the
Castle grounds and I had to stand on my toes outside
the walls for two hours before I could get a permit to
enter. American engineers are building the new railroad;
American capital controls the telephone and electric light
companies; there are two American moving picture
shows in Regengetz Circus and an American rush hand
laundry two blocks up. And you can get Bourbon
whisky anywhere. It's sickening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Americans have done much for Edelweiss, sir.
We don't resent their progressiveness. They have given
us modern improvements without overthrowing ancient
customs. My dear young sir, we are very old here&mdash;and
very honest. That reminds me that I should accept
your kind invitation to the Caf&eacute; garden. If you will
bear with me for just one moment, sir.&quot; With this
polite request, the old man retired to the rear of the
shop and called out to some one upstairs. A woman's
voice answered. The brief conversation which followed
was in a tongue unknown to King.</p>

<p>&quot;My niece will keep shop, sir, while I am out,&quot; Spantz
explained, taking his hat from a peg behind the door.
Truxton could scarcely restrain a smile as he glanced
over his queer little old guest. He looked eighty but was
as sprightly as a man of forty. A fine companion for
a youth of twenty-six in search of adventure!</p>

<p>They paused near the door until the old man's niece
appeared at the back of the shop. King's first glance
at the girl was merely a casual one. His second was
more or less in the nature of a stare of amazement.</p>

<p>A young woman of the most astounding beauty, attired
in the black and red of the Graustark middle classes,
was slowly approaching from the shadowy recesses at the
end of the shop. She gave him but a cursory glance, in
which no interest was apparent, and glided quietly into
the little nook behind the counter, almost at his elbow.
His heart enjoyed a lively thump. Here was the first
noticeably good-looking woman he had seen in Edelweiss,
and, by the powers, she was a sword-maker's niece!</p>

<p>The old man looked sharply at him for an instant, and
a quick little smile writhed in and out among the mass
of wrinkles. Instead of passing directly out of the shop,
Spantz stopped a moment to give the girl some suddenly
recalled instruction. Truxton King, you may be sure,
did not precede the old man into the street. He deliberately
removed his hat and waited most politely for
age to go before youth, in the meantime blandly gazing
upon the face of this amazing niece.</p>

<p>Across the square, at one of the tables, he awaited his
chance and a plausible excuse for questioning the old
man without giving offence. Somewhere back in his impressionable
brain there was growing a distinct hope
that this beautiful young creature with the dreamy eyes
was something more than a mere shopgirl. It had occurred
to him in that one brief moment of contact that
she had the air, the poise of a true aristocrat.</p>

<p>The old man, over his huge mug of beer, was properly
grateful. He was willing to repay King for his little
attention by giving him a careful history of Graustark,
past, present and future, from the time of Tartar rule
to the time of the so-called &quot;American invasion.&quot; ills
glowing description of the little Prince might have interested
Truxton in his Lord Fauntleroy days, but just at
present he was more happily engaged in speculating on
the true identify of the girl in the gun-shop. He recalled
the fact that a former royal princess of Graustark
had gone sight-seeing over the world, incognita,
as a Miss Guggenslocker, and had been romantically
snatched up by a lucky American named Lorry. What
if this girl in the gun-shop should turn out to be a&mdash;well,
he could hardly hope for a princess; but she might
be a countess.</p>

<p>The old mart was rambling on. &quot;The young Prince has
lived most of his life in Washington and London and
Paris, sir. He's only seven, sir. Of course, you remember
the dreadful accident that made him an orphan
and put him on the throne with the three 'wise men of
the East' as regents or governors. The train wreck
near Brussels, sir? His mother, the glorious Princess
Yetive, was killed and his father, Mr. Lorry, died the
next day from his injuries. That, sir, was a most appalling
blow to the people of Graustark. We loved the
Princess and we admired her fine American husband.
There never will be another pair like them, sir. And to
think of them being destroyed as they were&mdash;in the most
dreadful way, sir. Their coach was demolished, you
remember. I&mdash;I will not go into the details. You know
them, of course. God alone preserved the little Prince.
He was travelling with them, on the way from London to
Edelweiss. By some strange intervention of Providence
he had gone with his governess and other members of
the party to the luggage van in the fore part of the
train, which had stopped on a side track below the station.
The collision was from the rear, a broken rail
throwing a locomotive into the Princess's coach. This
providential escape of the young Prince preserved the
unbroken line of the present royal family. If he had
been killed, the dynasty would have come to an end, and,
I am telling no secret, sir, when I say that a new form
of government would have followed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What sort of government?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A more modern system, sir. Perhaps socialistic. I
can't say. At all events, a new dynasty could not have
been formed. The people would have rejected it. But
Prince Robin was spared and, if I do say it, sir, he is the
manliest little prince in all the world. You should see
him ride and fence and shoot&mdash;and he is but seven!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Mr. Spantz, I don't believe I've told you that
your niece is a most remarkably beau&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As I was saying, sir,&quot; interrupted Spantz, so pointedly
that Truxton flushed, &quot;the little Prince is the idol of all
the people. Under the present regency he is obliged
to reside in the principality until his fifteenth year, after
which he may be permitted to travel abroad. Graustark
intends to preserve him to herself if it is in her power
to do so. Woe betide the man who thinks or does ill
toward little Prince Robin.&quot;</p>

<p>King was suddenly conscious of a strange intentness of
gaze on the old man's part. A peculiar, indescribable
chill swept over him; he had a distinct, vivid impression
that some subtle power was exercising itself upon him&mdash;a
power that, for the briefest instant, held him in a grip
of iron. What it was, he could not have told; it passed
almost immediately. Something in the old man's eyes,
perhaps&mdash;or was it something in the queer smile that
flickered about his lips?</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Mr. Spantz,&quot; he hastened to say, as if a
defence were necessary, &quot;please don't get it into your
head that I'm thinking ill of the Prince. I daresay he's
a fine little chap and I'm sorry he's&mdash;er&mdash;lost his parents.&quot;</p>

<p>Spantz laughed, a soft, mirthless gurgle that caused
Truxton to wonder why he had made the effort at all.
&quot;I imagine His Serene Highness has little to fear from
any American,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;He has been taught to
love and respect the men of his father's land. He loves
America quite as dearly as he loves Graustark.&quot; Despite
the seeming sincerity of the remark, Truxton was
vaguely conscious that a peculiar harshness had crept
into the other's voice. He glanced sharply at the old
man's face. For the first time he noticed something sinister&mdash;yes,
evil&mdash;in the leathery countenance; a stealthiness
in the hard smile that seemed to transform it at once
into a pronounced leer. Like a flash there darted into the
American's active brain a conviction that there could
be no common relationship between this flinty old man
and the delicate, refined girl he had seen in the shop.
Now he recalled the fact that her dark eyes had a look
of sadness and dejection in their depths, and that her
face was peculiarly white and unsmiling.</p>

<p>Spantz was eyeing him narrowly. &quot;You do not appear
interested in our royal family,&quot; he ventured coldly.</p>

<p>Truxton hastened to assure him that he was keenly interested.
Especially so, now that I appreciate that the
little Prince is the last of his race.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are three regents, sir, in charge of the affairs
of state&mdash;Count Halfont, the Duke of Perse and Baron
Jasto Dangloss, who is minister of police. Count Halfont
is a granduncle of the Prince, by marriage. The
Duke of Perse is the father of the unhappy Countess
Ingomede, the young and beautiful wife of the exiled
&quot;Iron Count&quot; Marlanx. No doubt you've heard of him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've read something about him. Sort of a gay old
bounder, wasn't he? Seems to me I recall the stories that
were printed about him a few years ago. I remember
that he was banished from the principality and his estates
seized by the Crown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite true, sir. He was banished in 1901 and now
resides on his estates in Austria. Three years ago, in
Buda Pesth, he was married to Ingomede, the daughter
of the Duke. Count Marlanx has great influence at the
Austrian court. Despite the fact that he is a despised
and discredited man in his own country, he still is a
power among people high in the government of more
than one empire. The Duke of Perse realised this when
he compelled his daughter to accept him as her husband.
The fair Ingomede is less than twenty-five years of age;
the Iron Count is fully sixty-five.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She ought to be rescued,&quot; was King's only comment,
but there was no mistaking the gleam of interest in his
steady grey eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Rescued?&quot; repeated the old man, with a broad grin.
&quot;And why? She is mistress of one of the finest old
castles in Austria, Schloss Marlanx, and she is quite
beautiful enough to have lovers by the score when the
Count grows a little blinder and less jealous. She is in
Edelweiss at present, visiting her father. The Count
never comes here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to see her if she's really beautiful. I've seen
but one pretty woman in this whole blamed town&mdash;your
niece, Herr Spantz. I've looked 'em over pretty carefully,
too. She is exceedingly attract&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, sir, but it is not the custom in Graustark
to discuss our women in the public drinking places.&quot;
King felt as if he had received a slap in the face. He
turned a fiery red under his tan and mumbled some sort
of an apology. &quot;The Countess is a public personage,
however, and we may speak of her,&quot; went on the old man
quickly, as the American, in his confusion, called a waiter
to replenish the tankards. The steely glitter that leaped
into the armourer's eyes at this second reference to his
niece disappeared as quickly as it came; somehow it left
behind the impression that he knew how to wield the
deadly blades he wrought.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to hear more about her,&quot; murmured Mr. King.
&quot;Anything to pass the time away, Mr. Spantz. As I
said before, I journeyed far to reach this land of fair
women and if there's one to be seen, I'm properly eager
to jump at the chance. I've been here two days and I've
seen nothing that could start up the faintest flutter
around my heart. I'm sorry to say, my good friend, that
the women I've seen in the streets of Edelweiss are not
beauties. I won't say that they'd stop a clock, but they'd
cause it to lose two or three hours a day, all right
enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will not find the beautiful women of Edelweiss in
the streets, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't they ever go out shopping?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hardly. The merchants, if you will but notice, carry
their wares to the houses of the noble and the rich.
Graustark ladies of quality would no more think of
setting foot in a shop or bazaar than they would think
of entering a third class carriage. Believe me, there are
many beautiful women in the homes along Castle Avenue.
Noblemen come hundreds of miles to pay court to them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just the same, I'm disgusted with the place. It's not
what it's cracked up to be. Saturday will see me on
my way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrow the garrison at the fortress marches in
review before the Prince. If you should happen to be
on the avenue near the Castle gate at twelve o'clock, you
will see the beauty and chivalry of Graustark. The
soldiers are not the only ones who are on parade.&quot; There
was an unmistakable sneer in his tone.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't care much for society, I'd say,&quot; observed
Truxton, with a smile.</p>

<p>Spantz's eyes flamed for an instant and then subtly resumed
their most ingratiating twinkle. &quot;We cannot all
be peacocks,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;You will see the Prince,
his court and all the distinguished men of the city and
the army. You will also see that the man who rides
beside the Prince's carriage wheel is an American, while
Graustark nobles take less exalted places.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An American, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Have you not heard of John Tullis, the Prince's
friend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another seven-year-old?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. A grown man, sir. He, your countryman,
is the real power behind our throne. On his deathbed,
the Prince's father placed his son in this American's
charge and begged him to stand by him through thick
and thin until the lad is able to take care of himself.
As if there were not loyal men in Graustark who might
have done as much for their Prince!&quot;</p>

<p>King looked interested. &quot;I see. The people, no doubt,
resent this espionage. Is that it?&quot;</p>

<p>Spantz gave him a withering look, as much as to say
that he was a fool to ask such a question in a place so
public. Without replying, he got to his feet and made
ready to leave the little garden.</p>

<p>&quot;I must return. I have been away too long. Thank
you, sir, for your kindness to an old man. Good day,
sir, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on! I think I'll walk over with you and have
another look at that broadsword. I'm&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrow, sir. It is past time to close the shop for
to-day. Come to-morrow. Good day.&quot;</p>

<p>He was crossing the sidewalk nimbly before King could
offer a word of remonstrance. With a disappointed sigh,
the American sank back in his chair, and watched his odd
companion scurry across the square. Suddenly he became
conscious of a disquieting feeling that some one
was looking at him intently from behind. He turned
in his chair and found himself meeting the gaze of a
ferocious looking, military appearing little man at a
table near by. To his surprise, the little man's fierce
stare maintained its peculiarly personal intentness until
he, himself, was compelled to withdraw his own gaze in
some little confusion and displeasure. His waiter appeared
at his elbow with the change.</p>

<p>&quot;Who the devil is that old man at the table there?&quot;
demanded young Mr. King loudly.</p>

<p>The waiter assumed a look of extreme insolence. &quot;That
is Baron Dangloss, Minister of Police. Anything more,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. What's he looking so hard at me for? Does he
think I'm a pickpocket?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know as much as I, sir,&quot; was all that the waiter
said in reply. King pocketed the coin he had intended
for the fellow, and deliberately left the place. He could
not put off the feeling, however, that the intense stare of
Baron Dangloss, the watch-dog of the land, followed him
until the corner of the wall intervened. The now incensed
American glanced involuntarily across the square
in the direction of Spantz's shop. He saw three mounted
soldiers ride up to the curb and hail the armourer as he
started to close his doors. As he sauntered across the
little square his gaze suddenly shifted to a second-story
window above the gun-shop.</p>

<p>The interesting young woman had cautiously pushed
open one of the shutters and was peering down upon the
trio of red-coated guardsmen. Almost at the same instant
her quick, eager gaze fell upon the tall American,
now quite close to the horsemen. He saw her dark eyes
expand as if with surprise. The next instant he caught
his breath and almost stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>A shy, impulsive smile played about her red lips for a
second, lighting up the delicate face with a radiance that
amazed him. Then the shutter was closed gently,
quickly. His first feeling of elation was followed instantly
by the disquieting impression that it was a mocking
smile of amusement and not one of inviting friendliness.
He felt his ears burn as he abruptly turned off to
the right, for, somehow, he knew that she was peeping
at him through the blinds and that something about his
tall, rangy figure was appealing to her sense of the
ridiculous.</p>

<p>You will see at once that Truxton King, imaginative
chap that he was, had pounced upon this slim, attractive
young woman as the only plausible heroine for his prospective
romance, and, as such, she could not be guilty of
forwardness or lack or dignity. Besides, first impressions
are always good ones: she had struck him at the outset
as being a girl of rare delicacy and refinement.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Baron Dangloss was watching him
covertly from the edge of the Caf&eacute; garden across the
square.</p>

<h3>A MEETING OF THE CABINET</h3>


<p>At this time, the principality of Graustark was in a
most prosperous condition. Its affairs were under the
control of an able ministry, headed by the venerable
Count Halfont. The Duke of Perse, for years a resident
of St. Petersburg, and a financier of high standing,
had returned to Edelweiss soon after the distressing
death of the late Princess Yetive and her American husband,
and to him was entrusted the treasury portfolio.
He at once proceeded to endear himself to the common
people by the advocacy of a lower rate of taxation; this
meant the reduction of the standing army. He secured
new and advantageous treaties with old and historic
foes, putting Graustark's financial credit upon a high
footing in the European capitals. The people smugly
regarded themselves as safe in the hands of the miserly
but honest old financier. If he accomplished many things
by way of office to enhance his own particular fortune,
no one looked askance, for he made no effort to blind or
deceive his people. Of his honesty there could be no
question; of his financial operations, it is enough to say
that the people were satisfied to have their affairs linked
with his.</p>

<p>The financing of the great railroad project by which
Edelweiss was to be connected with the Siberian line in
the north, fell to his lot at a time when no one else could
have saved the little government from heavy losses or
even bankruptcy. The new line traversed the country
from Serros, capital of Dawsbergen, through the mountains
and canyons of Graustark, across Axphain's broad
steppes and lowlands, to a point at which Russia stood
ready to begin a connecting branch for junction with
her great line to the Pacific. All told, it was a stupendous
undertaking for a small government to finance; it
is well known that Graustark owns and controls her public
utility institutions. The road, now about half completed,
was to be nearly two hundred miles in length, fully
two-thirds of which was on Graustark territory. The
preponderance of cost of construction fell upon that
principality, Dawsbergen and Axphain escaping with
comparatively small obligations owing to the fact that
they had few mountains to contend with. As a matter
of fact, the Dawsbergen and Axphain ends of the railroad
were now virtually built and waiting for the completion
of the extensive work in the Graustark highlands.</p>

<p>The opening of this narrative finds the ministry preparing
to float a new five million gavvo issue of bonds
for construction and equipment purposes. Agents of
the government were ready to depart for London and
Paris to take up the matter with the great banking
houses. St. Petersburg and Berlin were not to be given
the opportunity to gobble up these extremely fine securities.
This seemingly extraordinary exclusion of
Russian and German bidders was the result of vigorous
objections raised by an utter outsider, the American,
John Tullis, long time friend and companion of Grenfall
Lorry, consort to the late Princess.</p>

<p>Tullis was a strange man in many particulars. He
was under forty years of age, but even at that rather
immature time of life he had come to be recognised as
a shrewd, successful financial power in his home city,
New York. At the very zenith of his power he suddenly
and with Quixotic disregard for consequences gave up
his own business and came to Graustark for residence,
following a promise made to Grenfall Lorry when the
latter lay dying in a little inn near Brussels.</p>

<p>They had been lifelong friends. Tullis jestingly called
himself the little Prince's &quot;morganatic godfather.&quot; For
two years he had been a constant resident of Graustark,
living contentedly, even indolently, in the picturesque old
Castle, his rooms just across the corridor from those
occupied by the little Prince. To this small but important
bit of royalty he was &quot;Uncle Jack&quot;; in that
capacity he was the most beloved and at the same time
the most abused gentleman in all Graustark. As many
as ten times a week he was signally banished from the
domain by the loving, headstrong little ruler, only to
be recalled with grave dignity and a few tears when he
went so far as to talk of packing his &quot;duds&quot; in obedience
to the edict.</p>

<p>John Tullis, strong character though he was, found
this lazy, <i>dolce far niente</i> life much to his liking. He
was devoted to the boy; he was interested in the life at
this tiny court. The days of public and court mourning
for the lamented Princess and her husband wearing away
after an established period, he found himself eagerly
delving into the gaieties that followed. Life at the Castle
and in the homes of the nobility provided a new and
sharp contrast to the busy, sordid existence he had known
at home. It was like a fine, wholesome, endless dream to
him. He drifted on the joyous, smiling tide of pleasure
that swept Edelweiss with its careless waves night and
day. Clever, handsome, sincere in his attitude of loyalty
toward these people of the topmost east, he was not long
in becoming a popular idol.</p>

<p>His wide-awake, resourceful brain, attuned by nature to
the difficulties of administration, lent itself capably to
the solving of many knotty financial puzzles; the ministry
was never loth to call on him for advice and seldom
disposed to disregard it. An outsider, he never offered a
suggestion or plan unasked; to this single qualification
he owed much of the popularity and esteem in which he
was held by the classes and the masses. Socially, he was
a great favourite. He enjoyed the freedom of the most
exclusive homes in Edelweiss. He had enjoyed the distinction
of more than one informal visit to old Princess
Volga of Axphain, just across the border, to say nothing
of shooting expeditions with young Prince Dantan of
Dawsbergen, whose American wife, formerly Miss Calhoun
of Washington, was a friend of long standing.</p>

<p>John Tullis was, beyond question, the most conspicuous
and the most admired man in Edelweiss in these serene
days of mentorship to the adored Prince Robin.</p>

<p>There was but one man connected with the government
to whom his popularity and his influence proved distasteful.
That man was the Duke of Perse. On more
than one occasion the cabinet had chosen to be guided
by the sagacity of John Tullis in preference to following
the lines laid down by the astute minister of finance.
The decision to offer the new bond issue in London and
Paris was due to the earnest, forceful argument of John
Tullis&mdash;outside the cabinet chamber, to be sure. This
was but one instance in which the plan of the treasurer
was overridden. He resented the plain though delicate
influence of the former Wall Street man. Tullis had
made it plain to the ministry that Graustark could not
afford to place itself in debt to the Russians, into whose
hands, sooner or later, the destinies of the railroad might
be expected to fall. The wise men of Graustark saw his
point without force of argument, and voted down, in the
parliament, the Duke's proposition to place the loan in
St. Petersburg and Berlin. For this particular act of
trespass upon the Duke's official preserves he won the
hatred of the worthy treasurer and his no inconsiderable
following among the deputies.</p>

<p>But John Tullis was not in Edelweiss for the purpose
of meddling with state affairs. He was there because he
elected to stand mentor to the son of his life-long friend,
even though that son was a prince of the blood and controlled
by the will of three regents chosen by his own
subjects. He was there to watch over the doughty little
chap, who one day would be ruler unrestrained, but who
now was a boy to be loved and coddled and reprimanded
in the general process of man-making.</p>

<p>To say that the tiny Prince loved his big, adoring
mentor would be putting it too gently: he idolised him.
Tullis was father, mother and big brother to the little
fellow in knickers.</p>

<p>The American was a big, broad shouldered man, reddish
haired and ruddy cheeked, with cool grey eyes; his
sandy mustache was closely cropped and turned up ever
so slightly at the corners of his mouth. Despite his
colouring, his face was somewhat sombre&mdash;even stern&mdash;when
in repose. It was his fine, enveloping smile that
made friends for him wherever he listed, with men and
with women. More frequently than otherwise it made
more than friends of the latter.</p>

<p>One woman in Graustark was the source of never-ending
and constantly increasing interest to this stalwart
companion to the Prince. That woman was, alas! the
wife of another man. Moreover, she was the daughter
of the Duke of Perse.</p>

<p>The young and witty Countess of Marlanx came often
to Edelweiss. She was a favourite at the Castle, notwithstanding
the unhealthy record of her ancient and
discredited husband, the Iron Count. Tullis had not seen
the Count, but he had heard such tales of him that he
could not but pity this glorious young creature who
called him husband. There is an old saying about the
kinship of pity. Not that John Tullis was actually in
love with the charming Countess. He was, to be perfectly
candid, very much interested in her and very much
distressed by the fact that she was bound to a venerable
reprobate who dared not put his foot on Graustark soil
because once he had defiled it atrociously.</p>

<p>But of the Countess and her visits to Edelweiss, more
anon&mdash;with the indulgence of the reader.</p>

<p>At present we are permitted to attend a meeting of
the cabinet, which sits occasionally in solemn collectiveness
just off the throne room within the tapestried walls
of a dark little antechamber, known to the outside world
as the &quot;Room of Wrangles.&quot; It is ten o'clock of the
morning on which the Prince is to review the troops from
the fortress. The question under discussion relates to
the loan of 5,000,000 gavvos, before mentioned. At the
head of the long table, perched upon an augmentary pile
of law books surmounted by a little red cushion, sits the
Prince, almost lost in the hugh old walnut chair of his
forefathers. Down the table sit the ten ministers of the
departments of state, all of them loving the handsome
little fellow on the necessary pile of statutes, but all of
them more or less indifferent to his significant yawns and
perplexed frowns.</p>

<p>The Prince was a sturdy, curly-haired lad, with big
brown eyes and a lamentably noticeable scratch on his
nose&mdash;acquired in less stately but more profitable pursuits.
(It seems that he had peeled his nose while sliding
to second base in a certain American game that he was
teaching the juvenile aristocracy how to play.) His
wavy hair was brown and rebellious. No end of royal
nursing could keep it looking sleek and proper. He had
the merit of being a very bad little boy at times; that
is why he was loved by every one. Although it was considered
next to high treason to strike a prince of the
royal blood, I could, if I had the space, recount the details
of numerous fisticuffs behind the state stables in
which, sad to relate, the Prince just as often as not came
off with a battered dignity and a chastened opinion of
certain small fry who could not have been more than
dukes or barons at best. But he took his defeats manfully:
he did not whimper <i>les&eacute; majest&eacute;</i>. John Tullis,
his &quot;Uncle Jack,&quot; had proclaimed his scorn for a boy
who could not &quot;take his medicine.&quot; And so Prince Robin
took it gracefully because he was prince.</p>

<p>To-day he was&mdash;for him&mdash;rather oppressively dignified
and imperial. He may have blinked his weary eyes a
time or two, but in the main he was very attentive, very
circumspect and very much puzzled. Custom required
that the ruling prince or princess should preside over
the meetings of the cabinet. It is needless to observe
that the present ruler's duty ended when he repeated
(after Count Halfont): &quot;My lords, we are now in session.&quot;
The school-room, he confessed, was a &quot;picnic&quot;
compared to the &quot;Room of Wrangles&quot;: a fellow got a
recess once in a while there, but here&mdash;well, the only
recess he got was when he fell asleep. To-day he was
determined to maintain a very dignified mien. It appears
that at the last meeting he had created considerable
havoc by upsetting the ink well while trying to fill his
fountain pen without an injector. Moreover, nearly half
a pint of the fluid had splashed upon the Duke of Perse's
trousers&mdash;and they were grey, at that. Whereupon the
Duke announced in open conclave that His Highness
needed a rattling good spanking&mdash;a remark which distinctly
hurt the young ruler's pride and made him wish
that there had been enough ink to drown the Duke instead
of merely wetting him.</p>

<p>About the table sat the three regents and the other
men high in the administration of affairs, among them
General Braze of the Army, Baron Pultz of the Mines,
Roslon of Agriculture. The Duke of Perse was discussing
the great loan question. The Prince was watching
his gaunt, saturnine face with more than usual
interest.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, it is not too late to rescind the order promulgated
at our last sitting. There are five bankers in
St. Petersburg who will finance the loan without delay.
We need not delay the interminable length of time necessary
to secure the attention and co-operation of bankers
in France and England. It is all nonsense to say that
Russia has sinister motives in the matter. It is a business
proposition&mdash;not an affair of state. We need the
money before the winter opens. The railroad is now
within fifteen miles of Edelweiss. The bridges and tunnels
are well along toward completion. Our funds are
diminishing, simply because we have delayed so long in
preparing for this loan. There has been too much bickering
and too much inane politics. I still maintain that
we have made a mistake in refusing to take up the matter
with St. Petersburg or Berlin. Why should we prefer
England? Why France?&quot;</p>

<p>For some unaccountable reason he struck the table violently
with his fist and directed his glare upon the astonished
Prince. The explosive demand caught the ruler
by surprise. He gasped and his lips fell apart. Then
it must have occurred to him that the question could be
answered by no one save the person to whom it was so
plainly addressed. He lifted his chin and piped up
shrilly, and with a fervour that startled even the intense
Perse:</p>

<p>&quot;Because Uncle Jack said we should, that's why.&quot;</p>

<p>We have no record of what immediately followed this
abrupt declaration; there are some things that never leak
out, no matter how prying the chronicler may be. When
one stops to consider that this was the first time a question
had been put directly to the Prince&mdash;and one that
he could understand, at that&mdash;we may be inclined to
overlook his reply, but we cannot answer for certain
members of the cabinet. Unconsciously, the boy in
knickers had uttered a truth that no one else had dared
to voice. John Tullis <i>was</i> the joint stepping-stone and
stumbling-block in the deliberations of the cabinet.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the innocent rejoinder
opened the way to an acrid discussion of John Tullis. If
that gentleman's ears burned in response to the sarcastic
comments of the Duke of Perse and Baron Pultz, they
probably tingled pleasantly as the result of the stout
defence put up by Halfont, Dangloss and others. Moreover,
his most devoted friend, the Prince, whose lips were
sullenly closed after his unlucky maiden effort, was finding
it exceedingly difficult to hold his tongue and his
tears at the same time. The lad's lip trembled but his
brown eyes glowered; he sat abashed and heard the no
uncertain arraignment of his dearest friend, feeling all
the while that the manly thing for him to do would be to
go over and kick the Duke of Perse, miserably conscious
that such an act was impossible. His little body trembled
with childish rage; he never took his gaze from the face
of the gaunt traducer. How he hated the Duke of Perse!</p>

<p>The Duke's impassioned plea was of no avail. His
<i>confr&egrave;res</i> saw the wisdom of keeping Russia's greedy
hand out of the country's affairs&mdash;at least for the present&mdash;and
reiterated their decision to seek the loans in
England and France. The question, therefore, would
not be taken to Parliament for reconsideration. The
Duke sat down, pale in defeat; his heart was more bitter
than ever against the shrewd American who had induced
all these men to see through his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose there is no use in kicking against the
pricks,&quot; he said sourly as he resumed his seat. &quot;I shall
send our representatives to London and Paris next
month. I trust, my lords, that we may have no trouble
in placing the loans there.&quot; There was a deep significance
the dry tone which he assumed.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not apprehend trouble,&quot; said Count Halfont.
&quot;Our credit is still good, your Grace. Russia is not the
only country that is ready to trust us for a few millions.
Have no fear, your Grace.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is the delay that I am apprehensive of, your Excellency.&quot;</p>

<p>At this juncture the Prince, gathering from the manner
of his ministers that the question was settled to his liking,
leaned forward and announced to his uncle, the premier:</p>

<p>&quot;I'm tired, Uncle Caspar. How much longer is it?&quot;</p>

<p>Count Halfont coughed. &quot;Ahem! Just a few minutes,
your Highness. Pray be patient&mdash;er&mdash;my little man.&quot;</p>

<p>Prince Bobby flushed. He always knew that he was
being patronised when any one addressed him as &quot;my
little man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have an engagement,&quot; he said, with a stiffening of
his back.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot; said the Duke dryly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your Grace&mdash;a very important one. Of course,
I'll stay if I have to, but&mdash;what time is it, Uncle
Caspar?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is half past eleven, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goodness, I had a date for eleven. I mean a engagement&mdash;an
engagement.&quot; He glanced helplessly, appealingly
from Count Halfont to Baron Dangloss, his
known allies.</p>

<p>The Duke of Perse smiled grimly. In his most polite
manner he arose to address the now harassed Princeling,
who shifted uneasily on the pile of law books.</p>

<p>&quot;May your most humble subject presume to inquire
into the nature of your Highness's engagement?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may, your Grace,&quot; said the Prince.</p>

<p>The Duke waited. A smile crept into the eyes of the
others. &quot;Well, what is the engagement?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had a date to ride with Uncle Jack at eleven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you imagine that 'Uncle Jack' will be annoyed if
he is kept waiting by such a trivial matter as a cabinet
meeting, unfortunately prolonged?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know just what that means,&quot; murmured the
Prince. Then his face brightened. &quot;But I don't think
he'll be sore after I tell him how busy we've been.&quot;</p>

<p>The Duke put his hand over his mouth. &quot;I don't think
he'll mind half an hour's wait, do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He likes me to be very prompt.&quot;</p>

<p>Count Halfont interposed, good-humouredly. &quot;There
is nothing more to come before us to-day, your Grace,
so I fancy we may as well close the meeting. To my
mind, it is rather a silly custom which compels us to keep
the Prince with us&mdash;er&mdash;after the opening of the session.
Of course, your Highness, we don't mean to say that you
are not interested in our grave deliberations.&quot;</p>

<p>Prince Bobby broke in eagerly: &quot;Uncle Jack says I've
just <i>got</i> to be interested in 'em, whether I want to or not.
He says it's the only way to catch onto things and become
a regular prince. You see, Uncle Caspar, I've got
a lot to learn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your Highness, you have,&quot; solemnly admitted the
premier. &quot;But I am sure you <i>will</i> learn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Under such an able instructor as Uncle Jack you may
soon know more than the wisest man in the realm,&quot; added
the Duke of Perse.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, your Grace,&quot; said the Prince, so politely
that the Duke was confounded; &quot;I know Uncle Jack will
be glad to hear that. He's&mdash;he's afraid people may
think he's butting in too much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Butting in?&quot; gasped the premier.</p>

<p>At this the Duke of Perse came to his feet again, an
angry gleam in his eyes. &quot;My lords,&quot; he began hastily,
&quot;it must certainly have occurred to you before this that
our beloved Prince's English, which seems after all to
be his mother tongue, is not what it should be. Butting
in! Yesterday I overheard him advising your son,
Pultz, to 'go chase' himself. And when your boy tried
to chase himself&mdash;'pon my word, he did&mdash;what did our
Prince say? What <i>did</i> you say, Prince Robin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I forget,&quot; stammered Prince Bobby.</p>

<p>&quot;You said 'Mice!' Or was it&mdash;er&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, your Grace. Rats. I remember. That's what I
said. That's what all of us boys used to say in Washington.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God deliver us! Has it come to this, that a Prince of
Graustark should grow up with such language on his
lips? I fancy, my lords, you will all agree that something
should be done about it. It is too serious a matter.
We are all more or less responsible to the people he is to
govern. We cannot, in justice to them, allow him to
continue under the&mdash;er&mdash;influences that now seem to surround
him. He'll&mdash;he'll grow up to be a barbarian. For
Heaven's sake, my lords, let us consider the Prince's future&mdash;let
us deal promptly with the situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's he saying, Uncle Caspar?&quot; whispered the
Prince fiercely.</p>

<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; cautioned Count Halfont.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't sh! I am the Prince. And I'll say 'chase
yourself' whenever I please. It's good English. I'll
pronounce it for you in our own language, so's you can
see how it works that way. It goes like&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You need not illustrate, your Highness,&quot; the Premier
hastened to say. Turning to the Duke, he said coldly:
&quot;I acknowledge the wisdom in your remarks, your Grace,
but&mdash;you will pardon me, I am sure&mdash;would it not be
better to discuss the conditions privately among ourselves
before taking them up officially?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That confounded American has every one hypnotised,&quot;
exploded the Duke. &quot;His influence over this boy is a
menace to our country. He is making on oaf of him&mdash;a
slangy, impudent little&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Grace!&quot; interrupted Baron Dangloss sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Jack's all right,&quot; declared the Prince, vaguely
realising that a defence should be forthcoming.</p>

<p>&quot;He is, eh?&quot; rasped the exasperated Duke, mopping his
brow.</p>

<p>&quot;He sure is,&quot; pronounced the Prince with a finality that
left no room for doubt. They say that fierce little Baron
Dangloss, in striving to suppress a guffaw, choked so
impressively that there was a momentary doubt as to his
ever getting over it alive.</p>

<p>&quot;He is a mountebank&mdash;a meddler, that's what he is.
The sooner we come to realise it, the better,&quot; exclaimed
the over-heated Duke. &quot;He has greater influence over
our beloved Prince than any one else in the royal household.
He has no business here&mdash;none whatsoever. His
presence and his meddling is an affront to the intelligence
of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>But the Prince had slid down from his pile of books and
planted himself beside him so suddenly that the bitter
words died away on the old man's lips. Robin's face was
white with rage, his little fists were clenched in desperate
anger, his voice was half choked with the tears of indignation.</p>

<p>&quot;You awful old man!&quot; he cried, trembling all over, his
eyes blazing. &quot;Don't you say anything against Uncle
Jack. I'll&mdash;I'll banish you&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;banish you like
my mother fired Count Marlanx out of the country. I
won't let you come back here ever&mdash;never. And before
you go I'll have Uncle Jack give you a good licking.
Oh, he can do it all right. I&mdash;I hate you!&quot;</p>

<p>The Duke looked down in amazement into the flushed,
writhing face of his little master. For a moment he was
stunned by the vigorous outburst. Then the hard lines
in his face relaxed and a softer expression came into his
eyes&mdash;there was something like pride in them, too. The
Duke, be it said, was an honest fighter and a loyal Graustarkian;
he loved his Prince and, therefore, he gloried
in his courage. His own smile of amusement, which
broke in spite of his inordinate vanity, was the sign that
brought relief to the hearts of his scandalised <i>confr&egrave;res</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness does well in defending a friend and
counsellor,&quot; he said gently. &quot;I am sorry to have forgotten
myself in your presence. It shall not occur again.
Pray forgive me.&quot;</p>

<p>Prince Bobby was still unappeased. &quot;I <i>could</i> have you
beheaded,&quot; he said stubbornly. &quot;Couldn't I, Uncle
Caspar?&quot;</p>

<p>Count Halfont gravely informed him that it was not
customary to behead gentlemen except for the most
heinous offences against the Crown.</p>

<p>The Duke of Perse suddenly bent forward and placed
his bony hand upon the unshrinking shoulder of the
Prince, his eyes gleaming kindly, his voice strangely free
from its usual harshness. &quot;You are a splendid little
man, Prince Robin,&quot; he said. &quot;I glory in you. I shall not
forget the lesson in loyalty that you have taught me.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobby's eyes filled with tears. The genuine humility of
the hard old man touched his tempestuous little heart.</p>

<p>&quot;It's&mdash;it's all right, Du&mdash;your Grace. I'm sorry I
spoke that way, too.&quot;</p>

<p>Baron Dangloss twisted his imperial vigorously. &quot;My
lords, I suggest that we adjourn. The Prince must have
his ride and return in time for the review at one o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p>As the Prince strode soberly from the Room of Wrangles,
every eye was upon his sturdy little back and there
was a kindly light in each of them, bar none. The Duke,
following close behind with Halfont, said quietly:</p>

<p>&quot;I love him, Caspar. But I have no love for the man
he loves so much better than he loves any of us. Tullis
is a meddler&mdash;but, for Heaven's sake, my friend, don't
let; Bobby know that I have repeated myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Later on, the Prince in his khaki riding suit loped gaily
down the broad mountain road toward Ganlook, beside the
black mare which carried John Tullis. Behind them rode
three picked troopers from the House Guard. He had
told Tullis of his vainglorious defence in the antechamber.</p>

<p>&quot;And I told him, Uncle Jack, that you could lick him.
You can, can't you?&quot;</p>

<p>The American's face was clouded for a second; then, to
please the boy, a warm smile succeeded the frown.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Bobby, you dear little beggar, he could thresh me
with one hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; almost shrieked Prince Bobby, utterly dismayed.</p>

<p>&quot;He's a better swordsman than I, don't you see. Gentlemen
over here fight with swords. I know nothing about
duelling. He'd get at me in two thrusts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I think you'd better take some lessons from Colonel
Quinnox. It won't do to be caught napping.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I daresay you're right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Uncle Jack, when are you going to take me to
the witch's hovel?&quot; The new thought abruptly banished
all else from his eager little brain.</p>

<p>&quot;Some day, soon,&quot; said Tullis. &quot;You see, I'm not sure
that she's receiving visitors these days. A witch is a
very arbitrary person. Even princes have to send up
their cards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's telegraph her,&quot; in an inspired tone.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll arrange to go up with you very soon, Bobby. It's
a hard ride through the pass and&mdash;and there may be a
lot of goblins up there where the old woman keeps herself.&quot;</p>

<p>The witch's hovel was in the mountain across the most
rugged of the canyons, and was to be reached only after
the most hazardous of rides. The old woman of the
hills was an ancient character about whom clung a thousand
spookish traditions, but who, in the opinion of John
Tuilis, was nothing more than a wise fortune-teller and
necromancer who knew every trick in the trade of hoodwinking
the superstitious. He had seen her and he had
been properly impressed. Somehow, he did not like the
thought of taking the Prince to the cabin among the
mists and crags.</p>

<p>&quot;They say she eats boys, now and then,&quot; he added, as
if suddenly remembering it.</p>

<p>&quot;Gee! Do you suppose we could get there some day
when she's eating one?&quot;</p>

<p>As they rode back to the Castle after an hour, coming
down through Castle Avenue from the monastery road,
they passed a tall, bronzed young man whom Tullis at
once knew to be an American. He was seated on a big
boulder at the roadside, enjoying the shade, and was
evidently on his way by foot to the Castle gates to watch
the <i>beau monde</i> assembling for the review. At his side
was the fussy, well-known figure of Cook's interpreter,
eagerly pointing out certain important personages to
bun as they passed. Of course, the approach of the
Prince was the excuse for considerable agitation and
fervour on the part of the man from Cook's. He
mounted the boulder and took off his cap to wave it
frantically.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the Prince!&quot; he called out to Truxton King.
&quot;Stand up! Hurray! Long live the Prince!&quot;</p>

<p>Tullis had already lifted his hand in salute to his
countryman, and both had smiled the free, easy smile of
men who know each other by instinct.</p>

<p>The man from Cook's came to grief. He slipped from
his perch on the rock and came floundering to the ground
below, considerably crushed in dignity, but quite intact
in other respects.</p>

<p>The spirited pony that the Prince was riding shied and
reared in quick affright. The boy dropped his crop and
clung valiantly to the reins. A guardsman was at the
pony's head in an instant, and there was no possible
chance for disaster.</p>

<p>Truxton King unbent his long frame, picked up the
riding crop with a deliberateness that astonished the man
from Cook's, strode out into the roadway and handed it
up to the boy in the saddle.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Prince Bobby.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't mention it,&quot; said Truxton King with his most
engaging smile. &quot;No trouble at all.&quot;</p>

<h3>MANY PERSONS IN REVIEW</h3>


<p>Truxton King witnessed the review of the garrison.
That in itself was rather a tame exhibition for a man
who had seen the finest troops in all the world. A thousand
earnest looking soldiers, proud of the opportunity
to march before the little Prince&mdash;and that was all, so
far as the review was concerned.</p>

<p>But, alluringly provident to the welfare of this narrative,
the red and black uniformed soldiers were not the
only persons on review that balmy day in July. Truxton
King had his first glimpse of the nobility of Graustark.
He changed his mind about going to Vienna on
the Saturday express. A goodly number of men before
him had altered their humble plans for the same reason,
I am reliably informed.</p>

<p>Mr. King saw the court in all its glory, scattered along
the shady Castle Avenue&mdash;in carriages, in traps, in
motors and in the saddle. His brain whirled and his
heart leaped under the pressure of a new-found interest
in life. The unexpected oasis loomed up before his eyes
just as he was abandoning all hope in the unprofitable
desert of Romance. He saw green trees and sparkling
rivulets, and he sighed with a new, strange content. No,
on second thoughts, he would not go to Vienna. He
would stay in Edelweiss. He was a disciple of Micawber;
and he was so much younger and fresher than that distinguished
gentleman, that perhaps he was justified in
believing that, in his case, something was bound to &quot;turn
up.&quot;</p>

<p>If Truxton King had given up in disgust and fled to
Vienna, this tale would never have come to light. Instead
of being the lively narrative of a young gentleman's
adventures in far-away Graustark, it might have
become a tale of the smart set in New York&mdash;for, as you
know, we are bound by tradition to follow the trail laid
down by our hero, no matter which way he elects to fare.
Somewhat dismayed by his narrow escape, he confided
to his friend from Cook's that he could never have forgiven
himself if he had adhered to his resolution to leave
on the following day.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't know you'd changed your mind, sir,&quot; remarked
Mr. Hobbs in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you didn't know it,&quot; said Truxton. &quot;How
could you? I've just changed it, this instant. I didn't
know it myself two minutes ago. No, sir, Hobbs&mdash;or is it
Dobbs? Thanks&mdash;no, sir, I'm going to stop here for
a&mdash;well, a week or two. Where the dickens do these people
keep themselves? I haven't seen 'em before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they are the nobility&mdash;the swells. They don't
hang around the streets like tourists and rubbernecks,
sir,&quot; in plain disgust.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you were an Englishman,&quot; observed King,
with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I am, sir. I can't help saying rubbernecks, sir, though
it's a shocking word. It's the only name for them, sir.
That's what the little Prince calls them, too. You see,
it's one form of amusement they provide for him, and I
am supposed to help it along as much as possible. Mr.
Tullis takes him out in the avenue whenever I've got a
party in hand. I telephone up to the Castle that I've
got a crowd and then I drive 'em out to the Park here.
The Prince says he just loves to watch the rubbernecks
go by. It's great fun, sir, for the little lad. He never
misses a party, and you can believe it or not, he has
told me so himself. Yes, sir, the Prince has had more
than one word with me&mdash;from time to time.&quot; King
looked at the little man's reddish face and saw therein
the signs of exaltation indigenous to a land imperial.</p>

<p>He hesitated for an instant and then remarked, with a
mean impulse to spoil Hobbs's glorification: &quot;I have
dined with the President of the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>Hobbs was politely unimpressed. &quot;I've no doubt, sir,&quot;
he said. &quot;I daresay it was an excellent dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>King blinked his eyes and then turned them upon the
passing show. He was coming to understand the real
difference between men.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, who is that just passing&mdash;the lady in the victoria?&quot;
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&quot;That is the Countess Marlanx.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whew! I thought she was the queen!&quot;</p>

<p>Hobbs went into details concerning the beautiful
Countess. During the hour and a half of display he
pointed out to King all of the great personages, giving
a Baedeker-like account of their doings from childhood
up, quite satisfying that gentleman's curiosity and involving
his cupidity at the same time.</p>

<p>When, at last, the show was over, Truxton and the
voluble little interpreter, whom he had employed for
the occasion, strolled leisurely back to the heart of the
town. Something had come over King, changing the
quaint old city from a prosaic collection of shops and
thoroughfares into a veritable playground for Cinderellas
and Prince Charmings. The women, to his startled
imagination, had been suddenly transformed from lackadaisical
drudges into radiant personages at whose feet
it would be a pleasure to fall, in whose defence it would be
divine to serve; the men were the cavaliers that had called
to him from the pages of chivalrous tales, ever since the
days of his childhood. Here were knights and ladies
such as he had dreamed of and despaired of ever seeing
outside his dreams.</p>

<p>Hobbs was telling him how every one struggled to provide
amusement for the little Prince at whose court these
almost mythological beings bent the knee. &quot;Every few
days they have a royal troupe of acrobats in the Castle
grounds. Next week Tantora's big circus is to give a
private performance for him. There are Marionettes
and Punch and Judy shows, and all the doings of the
Grand Grignol are beautifully imitated. The royal band
plays every afternoon, and at night some one tells him
stories of the valorous men who occupied the throne before
him. He rides, plays baseball and cricket, swims,
goes shooting&mdash;and, you may take it from me, sir, he
is already enjoying fencing lessons with Colonel Quinnox,
chief of the Castle guard. Mr. Tullis, the American, has
charge of his&mdash;you might say, his education and entertainment.
They want to make of him a very wonderful
Prince. So they are starting at the bottom. He's quite
a wonderful little chap. What say, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was just going to ask if you know anything about a
young woman who occasionally tends shop for William
Spantz, the armourer.&quot;</p>

<p>Hobbs looked interested. &quot;She's quite a beauty, sir, I
give you my word.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that, Hobbs. But who is she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really can't say, sir. She's his niece, I've heard.
Been here a little over a month. I think she's from
Warsaw.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'll say good-bye here. If you've nothing on
for to-morrow we'll visit the Castle grounds and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;take
a look about the place. Come to the hotel early.
I'm going over to the gun-shop. So long!&quot; As he
crossed the square, his mind full of the beautiful women
he had seen, he was saying to himself in a wild strain of
exhilaration: &quot;I'll bet my head that girl isn't the nobody
she's setting herself up to be. She looks like these I've
just seen. She's got the marks of a lady. You can't
fool me. I'm going to find out who she is and&mdash;well,
maybe it won't be so dull here, after all. It looks better
every minute.&quot;</p>

<p>He was whistling gaily as he entered the little shop,
ready to give a cheery greeting to old Spantz and to
make him a temporising offer for the broadsword. But
it was not Spantz who stood behind the little counter.
Truxton flushed hotly and jerked off his hat. The girl
smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg pardon,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I&mdash;I'm looking for
Mr. Spantz&mdash;I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is out. Will you wait? He will return in a very
few minutes.&quot; Her voice was clear and low, her accent
charming. The smile in her eyes somehow struck him as
sad, even fleeting in its attempt at mirth. As she spoke,
it disappeared altogether and an almost sombre expression
came into her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks. I'll&mdash;wait,&quot; he said, suddenly embarrassed.
She turned to the window, resuming the wistful, preoccupied
gaze down the avenue. He made pretence of inspecting
the wares on the opposite wall, but covertly
watched her out of the corner of his eye. Perhaps, calculated
he, if she were attired in the gown of one of those
fashionables she might rank with the noblest of them in
beauty and delicacy. Her dark little head was carried
with all the serene pride of a lady of quality; her features
were clear cut, mobile, and absolutely flawless. He
was sure of that: his sly analysis was not as casual as
one might suppose under the circumstances. As a matter
of fact, he found himself having what he afterward
called &quot;a very good look at her.&quot; She seemed to have
forgotten his presence. The longer he looked at the
delicate profile, the more fully was he convinced that she
was not all that she pretended. He experienced a thrill
of hope. If she wasn't what she pretended to be, then
surely she must be what he wanted her to be&mdash;a lady of
quality. In that case there was a mystery. The thought
restored his temerity.</p>

<p>&quot;Beg pardon,&quot; he said, politely sauntering up to the
little counter. He noted that she was taller than he had
thought, and slender. She started and turned toward
him with a quick, diffident smile, her dark eyes filling
with an unspoken apology. &quot;I wanted to have another
look at the broadsword there. May I get it out of the
window, or will you?&quot;</p>

<p>Very quickly&mdash;he noticed that she went about it clumsily
despite her supple gracefulness&mdash;she withdrew the heavy
weapon from the window and laid it upon the counter.
He was looking at her with a peculiar smile upon his lips.
She flushed painfully.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not&mdash;not what you would call an expert,&quot; she
said frankly.</p>

<p>&quot;You mean in handling broadswords,&quot; he said in his
most suave manner. &quot;It's a cunning little thing, isn't
it?&quot; He picked up the ponderous blade. &quot;I don't wonder
you nearly dropped it on your toes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There must have been giants in those days,&quot; she said,
a slight shudder passing over her.</p>

<p>&quot;Whoppers,&quot; he agreed eagerly. &quot;I've thought somewhat
of buying the old thing. Not to use, of course.
I'm not a giant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're not a pigmy,&quot; she supplemented, her eyes
sweeping his long figure comprehensively.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the price?&quot; he asked, his courage faltering
under the cool, impersonal gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know. My uncle has told you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I think he did. But I've got a wretched memory
when it comes to broadswords.&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed. &quot;This is such a very old broadsword,
too,&quot; she said. &quot;It goes back beyond the memory of
man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How does it come that you don't know the price?&quot; he
asked, watching her narrowly. She met his inquiring
look with perfect composure.</p>

<p>&quot;I am quite new at the trade. I hope you will excuse
my ignorance. My uncle will be here in a moment.&quot; She
was turning away with an air that convinced King of
one thing: she was a person who, in no sense, had ever
been called upon to serve others.</p>

<p>&quot;So I've heard,&quot; he observed. The bait took effect.
She looked up quickly; he was confident that a startled
expression flitted across her face.</p>

<p>&quot;You have heard? What have you heard of me?&quot; she
demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;That you are new at the business,&quot; he replied coolly.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a stranger in a strange land, so they say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have been making inquiries?&quot; she asked, disdain
succeeding dismay.</p>

<p>&quot;Tentatively, that's all. Ever since you peeked out of
the window up there and laughed at me. I'm curious,
you see.&quot;</p>

<p>She stared at him in silent intensity for a moment.
&quot;That's why I laughed at you. You were <i>very</i> curious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I so bad as all that?&quot; he lamented.</p>

<p>She ignored the question. &quot;Why should you be interested
in me, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. King was inspired to fabricate in the interest of
psychical research. &quot;Because I have heard that you are
not the niece of old man Spantz.&quot; He watched intently
to catch the effect of the declaration.</p>

<p>She merely stared at him; there was not so much as
the flutter of an eyelid. &quot;You have heard nothing of
the kind,&quot; she said coldly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'll confess I haven't,&quot; he admitted cheerfully.
&quot;I was experimenting. I'm an amateur Sherlock Holmes.
It pleases me to deduce that you are not related to the
armourer. You don't look the part.&quot;</p>

<p>Now she smiled divinely. &quot;And why not, pray? His
sister was my mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In order to establish a line on which to base my calculations,
would you mind telling me who your father
is?&quot; He asked the question with his most appealing
smile&mdash;a smile so frankly impudent that she could not
resent it.</p>

<p>&quot;My mother's husband,&quot; she replied in the same spirit.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that is <i>quite</i> a clue!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;'Pon my
soul, I believe I'm on the right track. Excuse me for
continuing, but is he a count or a duke or just a&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My father is dead,&quot; she interrupted, without taking
her now serious gaze from his face.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; he said at once. &quot;I'm sorry if
I've hurt you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My mother is dead. Now can you understand why I
am living here with my uncle? Even an amateur may
rise to that. Now, sir, do you expect to purchase the
sword? If not, I shall replace it in the window.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I came here for,&quot; said he, resenting her
tone and the icy look she gave him.</p>

<p>&quot;I gathered that you came in the capacity of Sherlock
Holmes&mdash;or something else.&quot; She added the last three
words with unmistakable meaning.</p>

<p>&quot;You mean as a&mdash;&quot; he hesitated, flushing.</p>

<p>&quot;You knew I was alone, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove, you're wrong there. I give you my word,
I didn't. If I'd known it, I'd surely have come in sooner.
There, forgive me. I'm particularly light-headed and
futile to-day, and I hope&mdash;Beg pardon?&quot;</p>

<p>She was leaning toward him, her hands on the counter,
a peculiar gleam in her dark eyes&mdash;which now, for the
first time, struck him as rather more keen and penetrating
than he had suspected before.</p>

<p>&quot;I simply want to tell you, Mr. King, that unless you
really expect to buy this sword it is not wise in you to
make it an excuse for coming here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear young lady, I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My uncle has a queer conception of the proprieties.
He may think that you come to see me.&quot; A radiant smile
leaped into her face, transforming its strange sombreness
into absolutely impish mirth.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, hang it all, he can't object to that, can he?
Besides, I never buy without haggling,&quot; he expostulated,
suddenly exhilarated, he knew not why.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't come in here unless you expect to buy,&quot; she
said, serious in an instant. &quot;It isn't the custom in Edelweiss.
Young men may chat with shopgirls all the world
over&mdash;but in Edelweiss, no&mdash;unless they come to pay
most honourable court to them. My uncle would not
understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I take it, however, that you would understand,&quot; he
said boldly.</p>

<p>&quot;I have lived in Vienna, in Paris and in London. But
now I am living in Edelweiss. I have not been a shopgirl
always.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can believe that. My deductions are justified.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pray forgive me for offering this bit of advice. A
word to the wise. My uncle would close the door in your
face if&mdash;if he thought&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Well, I'll buy the blooming sword. Anyhow,
that's what I came in for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. You came in because I smiled at you from the
window upstairs. It is my sitting-room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you smile? Tell me?&quot; eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;It was nature asserting itself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean you just couldn't help it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's precisely what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not very complimentary, I'd say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A smile is ever a compliment, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I say, do you know you interest me?&quot; he began
warmly, but she put her finger to her lips.</p>

<p>&quot;My uncle is returning. I must not talk to you any
longer.&quot; She glanced uneasily out upon the square, and
then hurriedly added, a certain wistfulness in her voice
and eyes. &quot;I couldn't help it to-day. I forgot my
place. But you are the first gentleman I've spoken to
since I came here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I was afraid you might think I am not a gentleman.
I've been rather fresh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I happen to have known many gentlemen. Before I
went into&mdash;service, of course.&quot; She turned away abruptly,
a sudden shadow crossing her face. Truxton
King exulted. At last he was touching the long-sought
trail of the Golden Girl! Here was Romance! Here
was mystery!</p>

<p>Spantz was crossing the sidewalk. The American
leaned forward and half-whispered: &quot;Just watch me buy
that broadsword. I may, in time, buy out the shop,
piece by piece.&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled swiftly. &quot;Let me warn you: don't pay his
price.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>When Spantz entered the door, a moment later, the
girl was gazing listlessly from the window and Truxton
King was leaning against the counter with his back
toward her, his arms folded and a most impatient frown
on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; he said gruffly. &quot;I've been waiting ten minutes
for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Spantz's black eyes shot from one to the other. &quot;What
do you want?&quot; he demanded sharply. As he dropped his
hat upon a stool near, the door, his glance again darted
from the man to the girl and back again.</p>

<p>&quot;The broadsword. And, say, Mr. Spantz, you might
assume a different tone in addressing me. I'm a customer,
not a beggar.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl left the window and walked slowly to the rear
of the shop, passing through the narrow door, without
so much as a glance at King or the old man. Spantz was
silent until she was gone.</p>

<p>&quot;You want the broadsword, eh?&quot; he asked, moderating
his tone considerably. &quot;It's a rare old&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll give you a hundred dollars-not another cent,&quot;
interrupted King, riot yet over his resentment. There
followed a long and irritating argument, at the conclusion
of which Mr. King became the possessor of the
weapon at his own price. Remembering himself in time,
he fell to admiring some old rings and bracelets in a
cabinet near by, thus paving the way for future visits.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll come in again,&quot; he said indifferently.</p>

<p>&quot;But you are leaving to-morrow, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've changed my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not for a few days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you have discovered something in Edelweiss to
attract you?&quot; grinned the old armourer. &quot;I thought
you might.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've had a glimpse of the swells, my good friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's all the good you'll get of it,&quot; said Spantz gruffly.</p>

<p>&quot;I daresay you're right. Clean that sword up a bit for
me, and I'll drop in to-morrow and get it. Here's sixty
gavvos to bind the bargain. The rest on delivery.
Good day, Mr. Spantz.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good day, Mr. King.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you happen to know my name?&quot;</p>

<p>Spantz put his hand over his heart and delivered himself
of a most impressive bow. &quot;When so distinguished
a visitor comes to our little city,&quot; he said, &quot;we lose no
time in discovering his name. It is a part of our trade,
sir, believe me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so sure that I do believe you,&quot; said Truxton
King to himself as he sauntered up the street toward the
Hotel. &quot;The girl knew me, too, now that I come to
think of it. Heigho! By Jove, I <i>do</i> hope I can work
up a little something to interest&mdash;Hello!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs, from Cook's, was at his elbow, his eyes
glistening with eagerness.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, old Dangloss is waiting for you at the Regengetz,
sir. Wot's up? Wot you been up to, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Up to? Up to, Hobbs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My word, sir, you must have been or he wouldn't be
there to see you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who is Dangloss?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Minister of Police&mdash;haven't I told you? He's a keen
one, too, take my word for it. He's got Sherlock beat a
mile.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So have I, Hobbs. I'm not slow at Sherlocking, let
me tell you that. How do you know he's waiting to see
me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard him ask for you. And I was there just now
when one of his men came in and told him you were on
your way up from the gunshop down there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So they're watching me, eh? 'Gad, this is fine!&quot;</p>

<p>He lost no time in getting to the hotel. A well-remembered,
fierce-looking little man in a white linen suit
was waiting for him on the great piazza.</p>

<p>Baron Jasto Dangloss was a polite man but not to the
point of procrastination. He advanced to meet the
puzzled American, smiling amiably and twirling his imposing
mustachios with neatly gloved fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;I have called, Mr. King, to have a little chat with you
about your father,&quot; he said abruptly. He enjoyed the
look of surprise on the young man's face.</p>

<p>&quot;My father?&quot; murmured Truxton, catching his breath.
He was shaking hands with the Baron, all the while
staring blankly into his twinkling, snapping eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you join me at this table? A julep will not
be bad, eh?&quot; King sat down opposite to him at one of
the piazza tables, in the shade of the great trailing vines.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; was his only comment.</p>

<p>A waiter took the order and departed. The Baron produced
his cigarette case. King carefully selected one
and tapped its tip on the back of his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Is&mdash;has anything happened to my father?&quot; he asked
quietly. &quot;Bad news?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the contrary, sir, he is quite well. I had a cablegram
from him to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A cablegram?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I cabled day before yesterday to ask if he could
tell me the whereabouts of his son.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The deuce you say!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He replies that you are in Teheran.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is the meaning of this, Baron?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a habit I have. I make it a practice to keep in
touch with the movements of our guests.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. You want to know all about me; why I'm here,
where I came from, and all that. Well, I'm ready for
the 'sweat box.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pray do not take offence. It is my rule. It would not
be altered if the King of England came. Ah, here are
the juleps. Quick service, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Remarkably so, due to your powers of persuasion, I
fancy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really ordered them a few minutes before you
arrived. You see, I was quite certain you'd have one.
You take one about this hour every day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove, you have been watching me!&quot; cried Truxton
delightedly.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing in Edelweiss, Mr. King?&quot; asked
the Baron abruptly but not peremptorily.</p>

<p>&quot;Sight-seeing and in search of adventure,&quot; was the
prompt response.</p>

<p>&quot;I fancied as much. You've seen quite a bit of the
world since you left home two years ago, on the twenty-seventh
of September.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Been to South Africa, Asia and&mdash;South America&mdash;to
say nothing of Europe. That must have been an
exciting little episode in South America.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't mean to say&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know all about your participation in the revolution
down there. You were a captain, I understand,
during the three weeks of disturbance. Splendid! For
the fun of the thing, I suppose. Well, I like it in you.
I should have done it myself. And you got out of the
country just in time, if I remember rightly. There was
a price placed on your head by the distressed government.
I imagine they would have shot you if they could
have caught you&mdash;as they did the others.&quot; The old
man chuckled. &quot;You don't expect to return to South
America, do you? The price is still offered, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>King was glaring at him in sheer wonder. Here was
an episode in his life that he fondly hoped might never
come to light; he knew how it would disturb his mother.
And this foxy old fellow away off here in Graustark
knew all about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you're a wonder!&quot; in pure admiration.</p>

<p>&quot;An appreciated compliment, I assure you. This is all
in the way of letting you know that we have found out
something concerning your movements. Now, to come
down to the present. You expected to leave to-morrow.
Why are you staying over?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Baron, I leave that to your own distinguished powers
of deduction,&quot; said Truxton gently. He took a long
pull at the straw, watching the other's face as he did so.
The Baron smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;You have found the young lady to be very attractive,&quot;
observed the Baron. &quot;Where have you known her before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg pardon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not unusual for a young man in search of adventure
to follow the lady of his choice from place to
place. She came but recently, I recall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think I knew her before and followed her to Edelweiss?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not quite sure whether you have been in Warsaw
lately. There is a gap in your movements that I can't
account for.&quot;</p>

<p>King became serious at once. He saw that it was best
to be frank with this keen old man.</p>

<p>&quot;Baron Dangloss, I don't know just what you are
driving at, but I'll set you straight so far as I'm concerned.
I never saw that girl until the day before yesterday.
I never spoke to her until to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She smiled on you quite familiarly from her window
casement <i>yesterday</i>,&quot; said Dangloss coolly.</p>

<p>&quot;She laughed at me, to be perfectly candid. But what's
all this about? Who is she? What's the game? I don't
mind confessing that I have a feeling she is not what she
claims to be, but that's as far as I've got.&quot;</p>

<p>Dangloss studied the young man's face for a moment
and then came to a sudden decision. He leaned forward
and smiled sourly.</p>

<p>&quot;Take my advice: do not play with fire,&quot; he said
enigmatically.</p>

<p>&quot;You&mdash;you mean she's a dangerous person? I can't
believe that, Baron.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She has dangerous friends out in the world. I don't
mean to say she will cause you any trouble here&mdash;but
there is a hereafter. Mind you, I'm not saying she isn't
a good girl, or even an adventuress. On the contrary,
she comes of an excellent family&mdash;in fact, there were
noblemen among them a generation or two ago. You
know her name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I say, this is getting interesting!&quot; He was
beaming.</p>

<p>&quot;She is Olga Platanova. Her mother was married in
this city twenty-five years ago to Professor Platanova of
Warsaw. The Professor was executed last year for conspiracy.
He was one of the leaders of a great revolutionary
movement in Poland. They were virtually anarchists,
as you have come to place them in America.
This girl, Olga, was his secretary. His death almost
killed her. But that is not all. She had a sweetheart
up to fifteen months ago. He was a prince of the royal
blood. He would have married her in spite of the difference
in their stations had it not been for the intervention
of the Crown that she and her kind hate so well.
The young man's powerful relatives took a hand in the
affair. He was compelled to marry a scrawny little duchess,
and Olga was warned that if she attempted to entice
him away from his wife she would be punished. She
did not attempt it, because she is a virtuous girl&mdash;of
that I am sure. But she hates them all&mdash;oh, how she
hates them! Her uncle, Spantz, offered her a home.
She came here a month ago, broken-spirited and sick.
So far, she has been exceedingly respectful to our laws.
It is not that we fear anything from her; but that we
are obliged to watch her for the benefit of our big
brothers across the border. Now you know why I advised
you to let the fire alone.&quot;</p>

<p>King was silent for a moment, turning something over
in his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Baron, are you sure that she is a Red?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite. She attended their councils.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She doesn't look it, 'pon my word. I thought they
were the scum of the earth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The kind you have in America are. But over here&mdash;oh,
well, we never can tell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mind saying she interests me. She's pretty&mdash;and
I have an idea she's clever. Baron, let me understand
you. Do you mean that this is a polite way of
commanding me to have nothing to do with her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You put it broadly. In the first place, I am quite
sure she will have nothing to do with you. She loved
the husband of the scrawny duchess. <i>You</i>, my good
friend, handsome as you are, cannot interest her, believe me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I daresay you're right,&quot; glumly.</p>

<p>&quot;I am merely warning you. Young men of your age
and temperament sometimes let their fancies lead them
into desperate predicaments. I've no doubt you can take
care of yourself, but&mdash;&quot; he paused, as if very much in
doubt.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm much obliged. And I'll keep my eyes well opened.
I suppose there's no harm in my going to the shop to
look at a lot of rings and knick-knacks he has for sale?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the least. Confine yourself to knick-knacks,
that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't Spantz above suspicion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one is in my little world. By the way, I am very
fond of your father. He is a most excellent gentleman
and a splendid shot.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton stared harder than ever. &quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know him quite well. Hunted wild boars with him
five years ago in Germany. And your sister! She was
a beautiful young girl. They were at Carlsbad at the
time. Was she quite well when you last heard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She was,&quot; was all that the wondering brother could
say.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, come in and see me at the tower. I am there in
the mornings. Come as a caller, not as a prisoner,
that's all.&quot; The Baron cackled at his little jest. &quot;<i>Au
revoir!</i> Till we meet again.&quot; They were shaking hands
in the friendliest manner. &quot;Oh, by the way, you were
good enough to change your mind to-day about the
personal attractiveness of our ladies. Permit me to observe,
in return, that not a few of our most distinguished
beauties were good enough to make inquiries as to your
identity.&quot;</p>

<p>He left the American standing at the head of the steps,
gazing after his retreating figure with a look of admiration
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Truxton fared forth into the streets that night with a
greater zest in life than he had ever known before. Some
thing whispered insistently to his fancy that dreariness
was a thing of the past; he did not have to whistle to
keep up his spirits. They were soaring of their own
accord.</p>

<p>He did not know, however, that a person from the
secret service was watching his every movement. Nor,
on the other hand, is it at all likely that the secret service
operative was aware that he was not the only shadower
of the blithe young stranger.</p>

<p>A man with a limp cigarette between his lips was never
far from the side of the American&mdash;a man who had
stopped to pass the time of day with William Spantz,
and who, from that hour was not to let the young man
out of his sight until another relieved him of the task.</p>

<h3>TRUXTON TRESPASSES</h3>


<p>He went to bed that night, tired and happy. To his revived
spirits and his new attitude toward life in its present
state, the city had suddenly turned gay and vivacious.
Twice during the evening he passed Spantz's
shop. It was dark, upstairs and down. He wondered
if the unhappy Olga was looking at him from behind the
darkened shutters. But even if she were not&mdash;la, la!
He was having a good time! He was gay! He was
seeing pretty women in the caf&eacute;s and the gardens! Well,
well, he would see her to-morrow&mdash;after that he would
give proper heed to the Baron's warning! An anarchist's
daughter!</p>

<p>He slept well, too, with never a thought of the Saturday
express which he had lain awake on other nights to
lament and anathematise. Bright and early in the morning
he was astir. Somehow he felt he had been sleeping
too much of late.</p>

<p>There was a sparkle in his eyes as he struck out across
town after breakfast. He burst in upon Mr. Hobbs at
Cook's.</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Hobbs, how about the Castle to-day&mdash;in an hour,
say? Can you take a party of one rubbernecking this
A.M.? I like you, Hobbs. You are the best interpreter
of English I've ever seen. I can't help understanding
you, no matter how hard I try not to. I want you to
get me into the Castle grounds to-day and show me
where the duchesses dawdle and the countesses cavort.
I'm ashamed to say it, Hobbs, but since yesterday I've
quite lost interest in the middle classes and the component
parts thereof. I have suddenly acquired a thirst
for champagne&mdash;in other words, I have a hankering for
the nobility. Catch the idea? Good! Then you'll guide
me into the land of the fairies? At ten?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take you to the Castle grounds, Mr. King, all
right enough, sir, and I'll tell you all the things of interest,
but I'll be 'anged, sir, if I've got the blooming
nerve to introduce you to the first ladies of the land.
That's more than I can ever 'ope to do, sir, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lord bless you, Hobbs, don't look so depressed. I
don't ask you to present me at court. I just want to
look at the lilacs and the gargoyles. That's as far as I
expect to carry my invasion of the dream world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, sir, you understand there are certain parts
of the Park not open to the public. The grotto and the
playgrounds and the Basin of Venus&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll not trespass, so don't fidget, Hobbs. I'll be here
for you at ten.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs looked after the vigorous, happy figure as
it swung down the street, and shook his head mournfully.
Turning to the solitary clerk who dawdled behind the
cashier's desk he remarked with more feeling than was
his wont:</p>

<p>&quot;He's just the kind of chap to get me into no end of
trouble if I give 'im rope enough. Take it from me,
Stokes, I'll have my hands full of 'im up there this morning.
He's charged like a soda bottle; and you never
know wot's going to happen unless you handle a soda
bottle very careful-like.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton hurried to the square and across it to the
shop of the armourer, not forgetting, however, to look
about in some anxiety for the excellent Dangloss, who
might, for all he knew, be snooping in the neighbourhood.
Spantz was at the rear of the shop, talking to a
customer. The girl was behind the counter, dressed for
the street.</p>

<p>She came quickly out to him, a disturbed expression in
her face. As he doffed his hat, the smile left his lips;
he saw that she had been weeping.</p>

<p>&quot;You must not come here, Mr. King,&quot; she said hurriedly,
in low tones. &quot;Take your broadsword this morning
and&mdash;please, for my sake, do not come again. I&mdash;I
may not explain why I am asking you to do this, but I
mean it for your good, more than for my own. My
uncle will be out in a moment. He knows you are here.
He is listening now to catch what I am saying to you.
Smile, please, or he will suspect&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See here,&quot; demanded King, smiling, but very much in
earnest, &quot;what's up? You've been crying. What's he
been doing or saying to you? I'll give him a&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no! Be sensible! It is nothing in which you
could possibly take a hand. I don't know you, Mr.
King, but I am in earnest when I say that it is not safe
for you to come here, ostensibly to buy. It is too easily
seen through&mdash;it is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just a minute, please,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;I've heard
your story from Baron Dangloss. It has appealed to
me. You are not happy. Are you in trouble? Do you
need friends, Miss Platanova?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is because you would be a friend that I ask you to
stay away. You cannot be my friend. Pray do not
consider me bold for assuming so much. But I know&mdash;I
know <i>men</i>, Mr. King. The Baron has told you all about
me?&quot; She smiled sadly. &quot;Alas, he has only told you
what he knows. But it should be sufficient. There is no
place in my life for you or any one else. There never
can be. So, you see, you may not develop your romance
with me as the foundation. Oh, I've heard of your quest
of adventure. I like you for it. I had an imagination
myself, once on a time. I loved the fairy books and the
love tales. But not now-not now. There is no romance
for me. Nothing but grave reality. Do not question
me! I can say no more. Now I must be gone. I&mdash;I
have warned you. Do not come again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, for the warning,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;But I
expect to come in occasionally, just the same. You've
taken the wrong tack by trying to frighten me off. You
see, Miss Platanova, I'm actually looking for something
dangerous&mdash;if that's what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That isn't all, believe me,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;You can
gain nothing by coming. You know who I am. I cannot
be a friend&mdash;not even an acquaintance to you, Mr.
King. Good-bye! Please do not come again!&quot;</p>

<p>She slipped into the street and was gone. King stood
in the doorway, looking after her, a puzzled gleam in his
eyes. Old Spantz was coming up from the rear, followed
by his customer.</p>

<p>&quot;Queer,&quot; thought the American. &quot;She's changed her
tactics rather suddenly. Smiled at me in the beginning
and now cries a bit because I'm trying to return the
compliment. Well, by the Lord Harry, she shan't scare
me off like&mdash;Hello, Mr. Spantz! Good morning! I'm
here for the sword.&quot;</p>

<p>The old man glared at him in unmistakable displeasure.
Truxton began counting out his money. The customer,
a swarthy fellow, passed out of the door, turning to
glance intently at the young man. A meaning look and
a sly nod passed between him and Spantz. The man
halted at the corner below and, later on, followed King
to Cook's office, afterward to the Castle gates, outside
of which he waited until his quarry reappeared. Until
King went to bed late that night this swarthy fellow
was close at his heels, always keeping well out of sight
himself.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll come in soon to look at those rings,&quot; said King,
placing the notes on the counter. Spantz merely nodded,
raked in the bills without counting them, and passed the
sword over to the purchaser.</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, sir,&quot; he growled after a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;I hate to carry this awful thing through the streets,&quot;
said King, looking at the huge weapon with despairing
eye. Inwardly, he was cursing himself for his extravagance
and cupidity.</p>

<p>&quot;It belongs to you, my friend. Take it or leave it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take it,&quot; said Truxton, smiling indulgently. With
that he picked up the weapon and stalked away.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was on his way to the Castle
grounds, accompanied by the short-legged Mr. Hobbs,
who, from time to time, was forced to remove his tight-fitting
cap to mop a hot, exasperated brow, so swift was
the pace set by long-legs. The broadsword reposed
calmly on a desk under the nose of a properly impressed
young person named Stokes, cashier.</p>

<p>Hobbs led him through the great Park gates and up
to the lodge of Jacob Fraasch, the venerable high steward
of the grounds. Here, to King's utter disgust, he was
booked as a plain Cook's tourist and mechanically advised
to pay strict attention to the rules which would be
explained to him by the guide.</p>

<p>&quot;Cook's tourist, eh?&quot; muttered King wrathfully as they
ambled down the shady path together. He looked with
disparaging eye upon the plain little chap beside him.</p>

<p>&quot;It's no disgrace,&quot; growled Hobbs, redder than ever.
&quot;You're inside the grounds and you've got to obey the
rules, same as any tourist. Right this way, sir; we'll
take a turn just inside the wall. Now, on your left,
ladies and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;I should say&mdash;ahem!&mdash;sir, you may
see the first turret ever built on the wall. It is over four
hundred years old. On the right, we have&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See here, Hobbs,&quot; said King, stopping short, &quot;I'm
damned if I'll let you lecture me as if I were a gang of
hayseeds from Oklahoma.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, sir. No offence. I quite forgot, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just <i>tell</i> me&mdash;don't lecture.&quot;</p>

<p>For three-quarters of an hour they wandered through
the spacious grounds, never drawing closer to the Castle
than permitted by the restrictions; always coming up to
the broad driveway which marked the border line, never
passing it. The gorgeous beauty of this historic old
park, so full of traditions and the lore of centuries,
wrought strange fancies and bold inclinations in the head
of the audacious visitor. He felt the bonds of restraint;
he resented the irksome chains of convention; he murmured
against the laws that said he should not step
across the granite road into the cool forbidden world beyond&mdash;the
world of kings. Hobbs knew he was doomed
to have rebellion on his hands before long; he could see
it coming.</p>

<p>&quot;When we've seen the royal stables, we'll have seen
everything of any consequence,&quot; he hastened to say.
&quot;Then we'll leave by the upper gates and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hobbs, this is all very beautiful and very grand and
very slow,&quot; said King, stopping to lean against the
moss-covered wall that encircled the park within a park:
the grounds adjoining the grotto. &quot;Can't I hop over
this wall and take a peep into the grotto?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By no means,&quot; cried Hobbs, horrified. &quot;That, sir, is
the most proscribed spot, next to the Castle itself. You
<i>can't</i> go in there.&quot;</p>

<p>King looked over the low wall. The prospect was
alluring. The pool, the trickling rivulets, the mossy
banks, the dense shadows: it was maddening to think he
could not enter!</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't be in there a minute,&quot; he argued. &quot;And
I might catch a glimpse of a dream-lady. Now, I say,
Hobbs, here's a low place. I could jump&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. King, if you do that I am ruined forever. I am
trusted by the steward. He would cut off all my privileges&mdash;&quot;
Hobbs could go no further. He was prematurely
aghast. Something told him that Mr. King
would hop over the wall.</p>

<p>&quot;Just this once, Hobbs,&quot; pleaded his charge. &quot;No one
will know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the love of Moses, sir, I&mdash;&quot; Hobbs began to wail.
Then he groaned in dismal horror. King had lightly
vaulted the wall and was grinning back at him from the
sacred precincts&mdash;from the playground of princesses.</p>

<p>&quot;Go and report me, Hobbs, there's a good fellow. Tell
the guards I wouldn't obey. That will let you out, my
boy, and I'll do the rest. For Heaven's sake, Hobbs,
don't burst! You'll explode sure if you hold in like that
much longer. I'll be back in a minute.&quot;</p>

<p>He strode off across the bright green turf toward the
source of all this enchantment, leaving poor Mr. Hobbs
braced against the wall, weak-kneed and helpless. If he
heard the frantic, though subdued, whistles and the
agonized &quot;hi!&quot; of the man from Cook's a minute or two
later, he gave no heed to the warning. A glimpse behind
might have shown him the error of his ways, reflected in
the disappearance of Hobbs's head below the top of the
wall. But he was looking ahead, drinking in the forbidden
beauties of this fascinating little nook of nature.</p>

<p>Never in all his wanderings had he looked upon a more
inviting spot than this. He came to the edge of the
deep blue pool, above which could be seen the entrance to
the Grotto. Little rivulets danced down through the
crannies in the rocks and leaped joyously into the tree-shaded
pool. Below and to the right were the famed
Basins of Venus, shimmering in the sunlight, flanked by
trees and banks of the softest green. On their surface
swam the great black swans he had heard so much about.
Through a wide rift in the trees he could see the great,
grey Castle, half a mile away, towering against the dense
greens of the nearby mountain. The picture took his
breath away. He forgot Hobbs. He forgot that he was;
trespassing. Here, at last, was the Graustark he had
seen in his dreams, had come to feel in his imagination.</p>

<p>Regardless of surroundings or consequences, he sat
down upon the nearest stone bench, and removed his hat.
He was hot and tired and the air was cool. He would
drink it in as if it were an ambrosial nectar in&mdash;and,
moreover, he would also enjoy a cigarette. Carefully he
refrained from throwing the burnt-out match into the
pool below: even such as he could feel that it might be
desecration. As he leaned back with a sigh of exquisite
ease and a splendid exhalation of Turkish smoke, a
small, imperious voice from somewhere behind broke in
upon his primary reflections.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing in here?&quot; demanded the voice.</p>

<p>Truxton, conscious of guilt, whirled with as much consternation
as if he had been accosted by a voice of
thunder. He beheld a very small boy standing at the
top of the knoll above him, not thirty feet away. His
face was quite as dirty as any small boy's should be at
that time of day, and his curly brown hair looked as if
it had not been combed since the day before. His firm
little legs, in half hose and presumably white knickers,
were spread apart and his hands were in his pockets.</p>

<p><a name="page_067" id="page_067" />
King recognised him at once, and looked about uneasily
for the attendants whom he knew should be near. It is
safe to say that he came to his feet and bowed deeply,
even in humility.</p>

<p>&quot;I am resting, your Highness,&quot; he said meekly.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you know any better than to come in here?&quot; demanded
the Prince. Truxton turned very red.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry. I'll go at once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm not going to put you out,&quot; hastily exclaimed
the Prince, coming down the slope. &quot;But you are old
enough to know better. The guards might shoot you if
they caught you here.&quot; He came quite close to the trespasser.
King saw the scratch on his nose. &quot;Oh, I know
you now. You are the gentleman who picked up my
crop yesterday. You are an American.&quot; A friendly
smile illumined his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, a lonely American,&quot; with an attempt at the
pathetic.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's your home at?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;New York. Quite a distance from here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ever been in Central Park?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A thousand times. It isn't as nice as this one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's got amilies&mdash;no, I don't mean that,&quot; supplemented
the Prince, flushing painfully. &quot;I mean&mdash;an-i-muls,&quot;
very deliberately. &quot;Our park has no elephunts or taggers.
When I get big I'm going to set out a few in the
park. They'll grow, all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've shot elephants and tigers in the jungle,&quot; said
Truxton. &quot;I tell you they're no fun when they get
after you, wild. If I were you I'd set 'em out in cages.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;P'raps I will.&quot; The Prince seemed very thoughtful.</p>

<p>&quot;Won't you sit down, your Highness?&quot;</p>

<p>The youngster looked cautiously about. &quot;Say, do
you ever go fishing?&quot; he demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;Occasionally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won't give me away, will you?&quot; with a warning
frown. &quot;Don't you tell Jacob Fraasch. He's the
steward. I&mdash;I know a fine place to fish. Would you
mind coming along? Look out, please! You're awful
big and they'll see you. I don't know what they'd do
to us if they ketched us. It would be dreadful. Would
you mind sneaking, mister? Make yourself little.
Right up this way.&quot;</p>

<p>The Prince led the way up the bank, followed by the
amused American, who stooped so admirably that the
boy, looking back, whispered that it was &quot;just fine.&quot;
At the top of the knoll, the Prince turned into a little
shrub-lined path leading down to the banks of the pool
almost directly below the rocky face of the grotto.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be afraid,&quot; he whispered to his new friend. &quot;It
ain't very deep, if you should slip in. But you'd scare
the fish away. Gee, it's a great place to catch 'em.
They're all red, too. D'you ever see red fish?&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton started. This was no place for him! The
Prince had a right to poach on his own preserves, but
a grown man to be caught in the act of landing the
royal goldfish was not to be thought of. He hung
back.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid I won't have time, your Highness. A friend
is waiting for me back there. He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's right here,&quot; pleaded the Prince. &quot;Please stop
a moment. I&mdash;I don't know how to put the bait on the
pin. I just want to catch a couple. They won't bite
unless there's worms on the hook. I tried 'em. Look
at 'em! Goodness, there's lots of 'em. Nobody can
see us here. Please, mister, fix a worm for me.&quot;</p>

<p>The man sat down behind a bush and laughed joyously.
The eager, appealing look in the lad's eyes went
to his heart. What was a goldfish or two? A fish has
no feeling&mdash;not even a goldfish. There was no resisting
the boyish eagerness.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you're a real boy, after all. I thought being
a prince might have spoiled you,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Jack says I can always be a prince, but I'll
soon get over being a boy,&quot; said Prince Bobby sagely.
&quot;You <i>will</i> fix it, won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>King nodded, conscienceless now. The Prince scurried
behind a big rock and reappeared at once with a willow
branch from the end of which dangled a piece of thread.
A bent pin occupied the chief end in view. He unceremoniously
shoved the branch into the hands of his confederate,
and then produced from one of his pockets a
silver cigarette box, which he gingerly opened to reveal
to the gaze a conglomerate mass of angle worms
and grubs.</p>

<p>&quot;A fellow gets awful dirty digging for worms, doesn't
he?&quot; he pronounced.</p>

<p>&quot;I should say so,&quot; agreed the big boy. &quot;Whose cigarette
case is this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Caspar's&mdash;I mean Count Halfont's. He's got
another, so he won't miss this one. I'm going to leave
some worms in it when I put it back in his desk. He'll
think the fairies did it. Do you believe in fairies?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly, Peter,&quot; said Truxton, engaged in impaling
a stubborn worm.</p>

<p>&quot;My name isn't Peter,&quot; said the Prince coldly.</p>

<p>&quot;I was thinking of Peter Pan. Ever hear of him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Say, you mustn't talk or you'll scare 'em away.
Is it fixed?&quot; He took the branch and gingerly dropped
the hook into the dancing pool. In less time than it
requires to tell it he had a nibble, a bite and a catch.
There never was a boy so excited as he when the scarlet
nibbler flew into the shrubbery above; he gasped with
glee. Truxton recovered the catch from the bushes and
coolly detached the truculent pin.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll have 'em for dinner,&quot; announced the Prince.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to catch a mess?&quot; queried the man,
appalled.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Bobby, casting again with a resolute
splash.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you not afraid they'll get onto you if you take
them to the Castle?&quot; asked the other diplomatically.
&quot;Goldfish are a dead give-away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody will scold 'cept Uncle Jack, and he won't
know about it. He's prob'ly gone away by this time.&quot;
King noticed that his lip trembled suddenly.</p>

<p>&quot;Gone away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He was banished this morning right after
breakfast.&quot; The announcement began with a tremor
but ended with imperial firmness.</p>

<p>&quot;Great Scott!&quot; gasped the other, genuinely shocked.</p>

<p>&quot;I banished him,&quot; said the Prince ruefully. &quot;But,&quot; with
a fine smile, &quot;I don't think he'll go. He never does. See
my sign up there?&quot; He pointed to the rocks near the
grotto. &quot;I did it with Hugo's shoe blacking.&quot;</p>

<p>A placard containing the important announcement,
&quot;NO FISHING ALOUD&quot; stared down at the poachers
from a tree trunk above. There was nothing very peremptory
in its appearance, but its designer was sufficiently
impressed by the craftiness it contained.</p>

<p>&quot;I put it up so's people wouldn't think anybody&mdash;not
even me&mdash;would dare to fish here. Oh, look!&quot; The
second of his ruddy mess was flopping in the grass.
Again Truxton thought of Mr. Hobbs, this time with
anxious glances in all directions.</p>

<p>&quot;Where do they think you are, your Highness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Out walking with my aunt. Only she met Count Vos
Engo, and while they were talking I made a sneak&mdash;I
mean, I stole away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then they'll be searching for you in all parts of the&mdash;&quot;
began Truxton, coming to his feet. &quot;I really must
be going. Please excuse me, your&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't go! I'll not let 'em do anything to you,&quot;
said the Prince staunchly. &quot;I like Americans better than
anybody else,&quot; he went on with deft persuasiveness.
&quot;They ain't&mdash;aren't afraid of anything. They're not
cowards.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton sat down at once. He could not turn tail in
the face of such an exalted opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not supposed to ever go out alone,&quot; went on the
Prince confidentially. &quot;You see, they're going to blow
me up if they get a chance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Blow you up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haven't you heard about it? With dynamite bums&mdash;bombs.
Yes, sir! That's the way they do to all
princes.&quot; He was quite unconcerned. Truxton's look
of horror diminished. No doubt it was a subterfuge
employed to secure princely obedience, very much as the
common little boy is brought to time by mention of the
ubiquitous bogie man.</p>

<p>&quot;That's too bad,&quot; commiserated Truxton, baiting the
pin once more.</p>

<p>&quot;It's old Count Marlanx. He's going to blow me up.
He hated my mother and my father, so I guess he hates
me. He's turrible, Uncle Caspar says.&quot;</p>

<p>King was very thoughtful for a moment. Something
vivid yet fleeting had shot through his brain&mdash;something
that he tried to catch and analyse, but it was
gone before he could grasp its significance. He looked
with new interest upon this serene, lovable little chap,
who was growing up, like all princes, in the shadow of
disaster.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fisherman's quick little ears caught a
sound that caused him to reveal a no-uncertain agitation.
He dropped his rod incontinently and crawled to
the opening in the shrubbery, peering with alarmed eyes
down the path along the bank.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it? A dynamiter?&quot; demanded Truxton uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;Worse'n that,&quot; whispered his royal Highness. &quot;It's
Aunt Loraine. Gee!&quot; To King's utter dismay, the
Prince scuttled for the underbrush.</p>

<p>&quot;Here!&quot; he called in consternation. The Prince
stopped, shamefaced on the instant. &quot;I thought you
were going to protect me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall,&quot; affirmed Bobby, manfully resuming his
ground. &quot;She's coming up the path. Don't run,&quot; he
exclaimed scornfully, as Truxton started for the rocks.
&quot;She can't hurt you. She's only a girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right. I won't run,&quot; said the big culprit, who
wished he had the power to fly.</p>

<p>&quot;And there's Saffo and Cors over there watching us,
too. We're caught. I'm sorry, mister.&quot;</p>

<p>On the opposite bank of the pool stood two rigid members
of the Royal Guard, intently watching the fishers.
King was somewhat disturbed by the fact that their
rifles were in a position to be used at an instant's notice.
He felt himself turning pale as he thought of what
might have happened if he had taken to flight.</p>

<p>A young lady in a rajah silk gown, a flimsy panama
hat tilted well over her nose, with a red feather that
stood erect as if always in a state of surprise, turned
the bushes and came to a stop almost at King's elbow.
He had time to note, in his confusion, that she was about
shoulder-high alongside him, and that she was staring
up into his face with amazed grey eyes. Afterward
he was to realise that she was amazingly pretty, that
her teeth were very white and even, that her eyes were
the most beautiful and expressive he had ever seen, that
she was slender and imperious, and that there were dimples
in her checks so fascinating that he could not
gather sufficient strength of purpose to withdraw his
gaze from them. Of course, he did not see them at the
outset: she was not smiling, so how could he?</p>

<p>The Prince came to the rescue. &quot;This is my Aunt
Loraine, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&quot; he swallowed hard and looked
helpless.</p>

<p>&quot;King,&quot; supplied Truxton, &quot;Truxton King, your
Highness.&quot; Then with all the courage he could produce,
he said to the beautiful lady: &quot;I'm as guilty as
he. See!&quot; He pointed ruefully to the four goldfish,
which he had strung upon wire grass and dropped into
the edge of the pool.</p>

<p>She did not smile. Indeed, she gave him a very severe
look. &quot;How cruel!&quot; she murmured. &quot;Bobby, you deserve
a sound spanking. You are a very naughty little
boy.&quot; She spoke rapidly in French.</p>

<p>&quot;He put the bait on,&quot; said Bobby, also in French.
Here was treachery!</p>

<p>Truxton delivered himself of some French. &quot;Oh, I
say, your Highness, you said you'd pardon me if I were
caught.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't pardon you until you are found guilty,&quot; said
the Prince in English.</p>

<p>&quot;Please put those poor little things back in the pool,
Mr. King,&quot; said the lady in perfect English.</p>

<p>&quot;Gladly&mdash;with the Prince's permission,&quot; said King,
also in English. The Prince looked glum, but interposed
no imperial objection. Instead he suddenly shoved the
cigarette box under the nose of his dainty relative, who
at that unpropitious instant stooped over to watch
King's awkward attempt to release the fishes.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at the worms,&quot; said the Prince engagingly,
opening the box with a snap.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried the young lady, starting back. &quot;Throw
them away! the horned things!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they can't bite,&quot; scoffed the Prince. &quot;See! I'm
not afraid of 'em. Look at this one.&quot; He held up a
wriggler and she fled to the rock. She happened to
glance at Truxton's averted face and was conscious of
a broad grin; whereupon she laughed in the quick staccato
of embarrassment.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that King's composure was sorely
disturbed. In the first place, he had been caught in a
most reprehensible act, and in the second place, he was
not quite sure that the Prince could save him from
ignominious expulsion under the very eyes&mdash;and perhaps
direction&mdash;of this trim and attractive member of
the royal household. He found himself blundering
foolishly with the fishes and wondering whether she was
a duchess or just a plain countess. Even a regal personage
might jump at the sight of angle worms, he reflected.</p>

<p>He glanced up, to find her studying him, plainly perplexed.</p>

<p>&quot;I just wondered in here,&quot; he began guiltily. &quot;The
Prince captured me down there by the big tree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you say your name is Truxton King?&quot; she
asked somewhat sceptically.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your&mdash;yes, ma'am,&quot; he replied. &quot;Of New York.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your father is Mr. Emerson King? Are you the
brother of Adele King?&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton stared. &quot;Have you been interviewing the
police?&quot; he asked before he thought.</p>

<p>&quot;The police? What have you been doing?&quot; she cried,
her eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>&quot;Most everything. The police know all about me.
I'm a spotted character. I thought perhaps they had
told you about me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I asked if you were Adele's brother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard her speak of her brother Truxton. She
said you were in South America.&quot;</p>

<p>He stared the harder. Could he believe his ears?</p>

<p>She was regarding him with cool, speculative interest.
&quot;I wonder if you are he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I am,&quot; he said, but doubtfully. &quot;Please pardon
my amazement. Perhaps I'm dreaming. At any
rate, I'm dazed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We were in the convent together for two years. Now
that I observe you closely, you <i>do</i> resemble her. We
were very good friends, she and I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you'll intercede for me?&quot; he urged, with a
fervent glance in the direction of the wall.</p>

<p>She smiled joyously. He realised then and there that
he had never seen such beautiful teeth, nor any creature
so radiantly beautiful, for that matter.</p>

<p>&quot;More than that,&quot; she said, &quot;I shall assist you to
escape. Come!&quot;</p>

<p>He followed her through the shrubbery, his heart
pounding violently. The Prince, who trotted on ahead,
had mentioned a Count. Was she married? Was she
of the royal blood? What extraordinary fate had made
her the friend of his sister? He looked back and saw
the two guardsmen crossing the bridge below, their eyes
still upon him.</p>

<p>&quot;It's very good of you,&quot; he said. She glanced back at
him, a quaint smile in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;For Adele's sake, if you please. Trespassing is a
very serious offence here. How did you get in?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hopped in, over the wall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd suggest that you do not hop out again. Hopping
over the walls is not looked upon with favour by the
guards.&quot;</p>

<p>He recalled the distressed Mr. Hobbs. &quot;The man
from Cook's tried to restrain me,&quot; he said in proper
spirit. &quot;He was very much upset.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dare say. You are a Cook's tourist, I see. How
very interesting! Bobby, Uncle Jack is waiting to take
you to see the trained dogs at the eastern gate.&quot;</p>

<p>The Prince gave a whoop of joy, but instantly regained
his dignity.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't go, auntie, until I've seen him safe outside
the walls,&quot; he said firmly. &quot;I said I would.&quot;</p>

<p>They came to the little gate and passed through, into
a winding path that soon brought them to a wide, main-travelled
avenue. A light broke in upon Truxton's mind.
He had it! This was the wonderful Countess Marlanx!
No sooner had he come to that decision than he was
forced to abandon it. The Countess's name was
Ingomede and she already had been pointed out to him.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose I shall have to recall Uncle Jack from
exile,&quot; he heard the Prince saying to the beautiful lady.
Truxton decided that she was not more than twenty-two.
But they married very young in these queer old countries&mdash;especially
if they happened to be princes or
princesses. He wanted to talk, to ask questions, to proclaim
his wonder, but discreetly resolved that it was best
to hold his tongue. He was by no means sure of himself.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, he was filled with a strange rejoicing.
Here was a woman with whom he was as sure to fall in
love as he was sure that the sun shone. He liked the
thought of it. Now he appreciated the distinction between
the Olga Platanova type and that which represented
the blood of kings. There <i>was</i> a difference!
Here was the true Patrician!</p>

<p>The Castle suddenly loomed up before them&mdash;grey and
frowning, not more than three hundred yards away.
He was possessed of a wild desire to walk straight into
the grim old place and proclaim himself the feudal
owner, seizing everything as his own&mdash;particularly the
young woman in the rajah silk. People were strolling
in the shady grounds. He felt the instant infection of
happy indolence, the call to luxury. Men in gay uniforms
and men in cool flannels; women in the prettiest
and daintiest of frocks&mdash;all basking in the playtime of
life, unmindful of the toil that fell to the Sons of
Martha out in the sordid world.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think you can find your man from Cook's?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Unless he has gone and jumped into the river, your&mdash;madam.
In any event, I think I may safely find my
way out. I shall not trouble you to go any farther.
Thank you for overlooking my indiscretion. Thank
you, my dear little Prince, for the happiest experience
of my life. I shall never forget this hour.&quot; He looked
boldly into her eyes, and not at the Prince. &quot;Have you
ever been in New York?&quot; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>He was not at all sure whether the look she gave him
was one of astonishment or resentment. At any rate,
it was a quick glance, followed by the palpable suppression
of words that first came to her lips, and the substitution
of a very polite:</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and I love it.&quot; He beamed. The smile that
came into her eyes escaped him. If he could have seen
it, his bewilderment; would have been sadly increased.</p>

<p>&quot;Say!&quot; whispered the Prince, dropping back as if to
impart a grave secret. &quot;See that man over there by the
fountain, Mr. King?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bobby!&quot; cried the lady sharply. &quot;Good-bye, Mr.
King. Remember me to your sister when you write.
She&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's Aunt Loraine's beau,&quot; announced the Prince.</p>

<p>&quot;That's Count Eric Vos Engo.&quot; Truxton's look turned
to one of interest at once. The man designated was a
slight, swarthy fellow in the uniform of a colonel. He
did not appear to be particularly happy at the moment.</p>

<p>The American observed the lady's dainty ears. They
had turned a delicate pink.</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask who&mdash;&quot; began Truxton timidly.</p>

<p>&quot;She will know if you merely call me Loraine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So long,&quot; said the Prince.</p>

<p>They parted company at once, the Prince and the
lady in the rajah silk going toward the Castle, King
toward the gates, somewhat dazed and by no means
sure of his senses. He came down to earth after he
had marched along on air for some distance, so to speak,
and found himself deciding that she was a duchess here,
but Loraine at school. What a wonderful place a
girl's school must be! And his sister knew her&mdash;knew a
lady of high degree!</p>

<p>&quot;Hobbs!&quot; he called, catching sight of a dejected figure
in front of the chief steward's door.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's you, is it?&quot; said Mr. Hobbs sullenly.</p>

<p>&quot;It is, Hobbs&mdash;very much me. I've been fishing with
royalty and chatting with the nobility. Where the
devil have <i>you</i> been?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been squaring it with old man Fraasch. I'm
through with you, sir. No more for me, not if I
know&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come along, Hobbs,&quot; said the other blithely, taking
Hobbs by the arm. &quot;The Prince sent his love to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he mention Cook's?&quot; gasped Hobbs.</p>

<p>&quot;He certainly did,&quot; lied Truxton. &quot;He spoke of you
most kindly. He wondered if you could find time to
come around to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<h3>THE COMMITTEE OF TEN</h3>


<p>It has been said before that Truxton King was the
unsuspecting object of interest to two sets of watchers.
The fact that he was under the surveillance of the
government police, is not surprising when we consider
the evident thoroughness of that department; but that
he should be continually watched by persons of a more
sinister cast suggests a mystery which can be cleared
up by visiting a certain underground room, scarce two
blocks from the Tower of Graustark. It goes without
saying that corporeal admittance to this room was not to
be obtained easily. In fact, one must belong to a certain
band of individuals; and, in order to belong to that
band, one must have taken a very solemn pledge of
eternal secrecy and a primal oath to devote his life to
certain purposes, good or evil, according to his conscience.
By means of the friendly Sesame that has
opened the way for us to the gentler secrets, we are permitted
to enter this forbidding apartment and listen in
safety to the ugly business of the Committee of Ten.</p>

<p>There were two ways of reaching this windowless
room, with its low ceilings and dank airs. If one had
the secret in his possession, he could go down through
the mysterious trap door in the workshop of William
Spantz, armourer to the Crown; or he might come up
through a hidden aperture in the walls of the great
government sewer, which ran directly parallel with and
far below the walls of the quaint old building. One
could take his choice of direction in approaching this
hole in the huge sewer: he could come up from the river,
half a mile away, or he could come down from the hills
above if he had the courage to drop through one of the
intakes.</p>

<p>It is of special significance that the trap door in
Spantz's workshop was reserved for use by the armourer
and his more fastidious comrades&mdash;of whom three were
women and one an established functionary in the Royal
Household. One should not expect ladies to traverse a
sewer if oilier ways are open to them. The manner of
reaching the workshop was not so simple, however, as
you might suppose. The street door was out of the
quest ion, with Dangloss on the watch, day and night.
As much as can be said for the rear door. It was necessary,
therefore, that the favored few should approach
the shop by extraordinary paths. For instance, two of
the women came through friendly but unknown doors
in the basements of adjoining houses, reaching the
workshop by the narrow stairs leading up from a cobwebby
wine-cellar next door. Spantz and Olga Platanova,
of course, were at home in the place. All of
which may go to prove that while ten persons comprised
the committee, at least as many more of the shopkeepers
in that particular neighbourhood were in sympathy with
their secret operations.</p>

<p>So cleverly were all these means of approach concealed
and so stealthy the movements of the Committee, that the
existence of this underground room, far below the street
level, was as yet unsuspected by the police. More than
that, the existence of the Committee of Ten as an organisation
was unknown to the department, notwithstanding
the fact that it had been working quietly,
seriously for more than a year.</p>

<p>The Committee of Ten represented the brains and the
activity of a rabid coterie in Edelweiss, among themselves
styled the Party of Equals. In plain language,
they were &quot;Reds.&quot; Less than fifty persons in Graustark
were affiliated with this particular community of anarchists.
For more than a year they had been preparing
themselves against the all-important hour for public
declaration. Their ranks had been augmented by occasional
recruits from other lands; their literature was
circulated stealthily; their operations were as secret as
the grave, so far as the outside world was concerned.
And so the poison sprung up and thrived unhindered in
the room below the street, growing in virulence and
power under the very noses of the vaunted police of
Edelweiss, slowly developing into a power that would
some day assert itself with diabolical fury.</p>

<p>There were men and women from Axphain and Dawsbergen
in this seed circle that made Edelweiss its spreading
ground. They were Reds of the most dangerous
type&mdash;silent, voiceless, crafty men and women who built
well without noise, and who gave out nothing to the
world from which they expected to take so much.</p>

<p>The nominal leader was William Spantz, he who had a
son in the Prince's household, Julius Spantz, the Master-of-arms.
Far off in the hills above the Danube there
lived the real leader of this deadly group&mdash;the Iron
Count Marlanx, exile from the land of his birth, hated
and execrated by every loyal Graustarkian, hating and
execrating in return with a tenfold greater venom.
Marlanx, the man who had been driven from wealth and
power by the sharp edict of Prince Robin's mother, the
lamented Yetive, in the days of her most glorious reign,&mdash;this
man, deep in his raging heart, was in complete
accord with the desperate band of Reds who preached
equality and planned disaster.</p>

<p>Olga Platanova was the latest acquisition to this select
circle. A word concerning her: she was the daughter
of Professor Platanova, one time oculist and sociologist
in a large German University. He had been one of
the most brilliant men in Europe and a member of a
noble family. There was welcome for him in the homes
of the nobility; he hobnobbed, so to speak, with the
leading men of time Empire. The Platanova home in
Warsaw was one of the most inviting and exclusive in
that great, city. The professor's enthusiasm finally carried
him from the conservative paths in which he had
walked; after he had passed his fiftieth year he became
an avowed leader among the anarchists and revolutionists
in Poland, his native state. Less than a year before
the opening of this tale he was executed for treason and
conspiracy against the Empire.</p>

<p>His daughter, Olga, was recognised as one of the most
beautiful and cultured young women in Warsaw. Her
suitors seemed to be without number; nor were they confined
to the student and untitled classes with whom she
was naturally thrown by force of circumstance. More
than one lordly adventurer in the lists of love paid
homage to her grace and beauty. Finally there came
one who conquered and was beloved. He was the son of
a mighty duke, a prince of the blood.</p>

<p>It was true love for both of them. The young prince
pledged himself to marry her, despite all opposition;
he was ready to give up his noble inheritance for the
sake of love. But there were other forces greater than
a young man's love at work. The all-powerful ruler of
an Empire learned of this proposed mesalliance and was
horrified. Two weeks afterward the prince was called.
The will of the Crown was made known to him and&mdash;he
obeyed. Olga Platanova was cast aside but not forgotten.
He became the husband of an unloved, scrawny
lady of diadems. When the situation became more than
he could bear he blew out his brains.</p>

<p>When Olga heard the news of his death she was not
stricken by grief. She cried out her joy to a now cloudless
sky, for he had justified the great love that had
been theirs and would be theirs to the end of time.</p>

<p>From a passive believer in the doctrines of her father
and his circle she became at once their most impassioned
exponent. Over night she changed from a gentle-hearted
girl into a woman whose breast flamed with a
lust for vengeance against a class from which death
alone could free her lover. She threw herself, heart and
soul, into the deliberations and transactions of the great
red circle: her father understood and yet was amazed.</p>

<p>Then he was put to death by the class she had come to
hate. One more stone in the sepulchre of her tender,
girlish ideals. When the time came she travelled to
Graustark in response to the call of the Committee of
Ten; she came prepared to kill the creature she would
be asked to kill. And yet down in her heart she was
sore afraid.</p>

<p>She was there, not to kill a man grown old in wrongs
to her people, but to destroy the life of a gentle, innocent
boy of seven!</p>

<p>There were times when her heart shrank from the unholy
deed she had been selected to perform; she even
prayed that death might come to her before the hour in
which she was to do this execrable thing in behalf of the
humanity she served. But there was never a thought
of receding from the bloody task set down for her&mdash;a
task so morbid, so horrid that even the most vicious of
men gloated in the satisfaction that they had not been
chosen in her place. Weeks before she came to Graustark
Olga Platanova had been chosen by lot to be the
one to do this diabolical murder. She did not flinch,
but came resolute and ready. Even the men in the Committee
of Ten looked upon the slender, dark-eyed girl
with an awe that could not be conquered. She had not
the manner of an assassin, and yet they knew that she
would not draw back; she was as soft and as sweet as the
Madonnas they secretly worshipped, and yet her heart
was steeled to a purpose that appalled the fiercest of
them.</p>

<p>On a Saturday night, following the last visit of Truxton
King to the armourer, the Committee of Ten met in
the underground room to hear the latest word from one
who could not be with them in person, but was always
there in spirit&mdash;if they were to believe his most zealous
utterances. The Iron Count Marlanx, professed hater
of all that was rich and noble, was the power behind the
Committee of Ten. The assassination of the little
Prince and the overthrow of the royal family awaited
his pleasure: he was the man who would give the word.</p>

<p>Not until he was ready could anything be done, for
Marlanx had promised to put the Committee of Ten in
control of this pioneer community when it came under
the dominion of anarchists.</p>

<p>Alas, for the Committee of Ten! The wiliest fox in
the history of the world was never so wily as the Iron
Count. Some day they were to find out that he was
using them to pull his choicest chestnuts from the fire.</p>

<p>The Committee was seated around the long table in the stifling,
breathless room, the armourer at the head.
Those who came by way of the sewer had performed
ablutions in the queer toilet room that once had been a
secret vault for the storing of feudal plunder. What
air there was came from the narrow ventilator that burrowed
its ways up to the shop of William Spantz, or
through the chimney-hole in the ceiling. Olga Platanova
sat far down the side, a moody, inscrutable expression
in her dark eyes. She sat silent and oppressed
through all the acrid, bitter discussions which carried
the conclave far past the midnight hour. In her heart
she knew that these men and women were already thinking
of her as a regicide. It was settled&mdash;it was ordained.
At Spantz's right lounged Peter Brutus, a lawyer&mdash;formerly
secretary to the Iron Count and now his sole
representative among these people. He was a dark-faced,
snaky-eyed young man, with a mop of coarse
black hair that hung ominously low over his high, receding
forehead. This man was the chosen villain
among all the henchmen who came at the beck and call
of the Iron Count.</p>

<p>Julius Spantz, the armourer's son, a placid young man
of goodly physical proportions, sat next to Brutus,
while down the table ranged others deep in the consideration
of the world's gravest problems. One of the women
was Madame Drovnask, whose husband had been sent
to Siberia for life; and the other, Anna Cromer, a rabid
Red lecturer, who had been driven from the United
States, together with her amiable husband: an assassin
of some distinction and many aliases, at present
foreman in charge of one of the bridge-building crews
on the new railroad.</p>

<p>Every man in the party, and there were eight, for
Olga was not a member of the Ten, wore over the lower
part of his face a false black beard of huge dimensions.
Not that they were averse to recognition among themselves,
but in the fear that by some hook or crook Dangloss
or his agents might be able to look in upon them&mdash;through
stone walls, as it were. They were not men to
belittle the powers of the wonderful Baron.</p>

<p>As it sat in secret conclave, the Committee of Ten was
a sinister-looking group.</p>

<p>Brutus was speaking. &quot;The man is a spy. He has
been brought here from America by Tullis. Sooner or
later you will find that I am right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is best to keep close watch on him,&quot; advised one
of the men. &quot;We know that he is in communication with
the police and we know that he visits the Castle, despite
his declaration that he knows no one there. To-day's
experience proves that. I submit that the strictest caution
be observed where he is concerned.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We shall continue to watch his every movement,&quot; said
William Spantz. &quot;Time will tell. When we are positive
that he is a detective and that he is dangerous, there
is a way to stop his operations.&quot;</p>

<p>His son grinned amiably as he swept his finger across
his throat. The old man nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Dangloss suspects more than one of us&quot; ventured
Brutus, his gaze travelling toward Olga. There was
lewd admiration in that steady glance. &quot;But we'll fool
the old fox. The time will soon be here for the blow
that frees Graustark from the yoke. She will be the
pioneer among our estates, we the first of the individuals
in equality; here the home seat of perfect rulership.
There is nothing that can stop us. Have we not the
most powerful of friends? Who is greater and
shrewder than Count Marlanx? Who could have
planned and perfected an organization so splendid?
Will any one dispute this?&quot;</p>

<p>He had the floor, and having the floor means everything
to a Red. For half an hour he spoke with impassioned
fervour, descanting furiously on the amazing
virtues of his wily master and the plans he had arranged.
It appeared in the course of his remarks that
Marlanx had friends and supporters in all parts of
Graustark. Hundreds of men in the hills, including
honest shepherds and the dishonest brigands who
thrived on them, coal miners and wood stealers, hunters
and outlaws were ready to do his bidding when the time
was ripe. Moreover, Marlanx had been successful in
his design to fill the railway construction crews with the
riff-raff of all Europe, all of whom were under the
control of leaders who could sway them in any movement,
provided it was against law and order. As a
matter of fact, according to Brutus, nearly a thousand
aliens were at work on the road, all of them ready to
revolt the instant the command was given by their
advisers.</p>

<p>Something that the Committee of Ten did not know
was this: those alien workmen were no less than so many
hired mercenaries in the employ of the Iron Count,
brought together by that leader and his agents for the
sole purpose of overthrowing the Crown in one sudden,
unexpected attack, whereupon Count Marlanx would
step in and assume control of the government. They
had been collected from all parts of the world to do the
bidding of this despised nobleman, no matter to what
lengths he might choose to lead them. Brutus, of
course, knew all this: his companions on the Committee
were in complete ignorance of the true motives that
brought Marlanx into their operations.</p>

<p>With a cunning that commands admiration, the Iron
Count deliberately sanctioned the assassination of the
little Prince by the Reds, knowing that the condemnation
of the world would fall upon them instead of upon
him, and that his own actions following the regicide
would at once stamp him as irrevocably opposed to
anarchy and all of its practices!</p>

<p>In the course of his remarks, Peter Brutus touched
hastily upon the subject of the little Prince.</p>

<p>&quot;He's not very big,&quot; said he, with a laugh, &quot;and it
won't require a very big bomb to blow him to smithereens.
He will&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; cried Olga Platanova, springing to her feet
and glaring at him with dilated eyes. &quot;I cannot listen
to you! You shall not speak of it in that way! Peter
Brutus, you are not to speak of&mdash;of what I am to do!
Never&mdash;never again!&quot;</p>

<p>They looked at her in amazement and no little concern.
Madame Drovnask was the first to speak, her glittering
eyes fastened upon the drawn, white face of the
girl across the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to fail? Are you weakening?&quot; she
demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;No! I am not going to fail! But I will not permit
any one to jest about the thing I am to do. It is a
sacred duty with me. But, Madame Drovnask&mdash;all
of you, listen&mdash;it is a cruel, diabolical thing, just the
same. Were it not in behalf of our great humanity,
I, myself, should call it the blackest piece of cruelty the
world has ever known. The slaughter of a little boy!
A dear, innocent little boy! I can see the horror in all
of your faces! You shudder as you sit there, thinking
of the thing I am to do. Yes, you are secretly despising
me, your instrument of death! I&mdash;I, a girl, I am to
cast the bomb that blows this dear little body to pieces.
I! Do you know what that means? Even though I
am sure to be blown to pieces by the same agent, the
last thing I shall look upon is his dear, terrified little
face as he watches me hurl the bomb. Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>She shuddered violently as she stood there before them,
her eyes closed as if to shut out the horrible picture
her mind was painting. There were other white faces
and ice-cold veins about the table. The sneer on Anna
Cromer's face deepened.</p>

<p>&quot;She will bungle it,&quot; came in an angry hiss from her
lips.</p>

<p>Olga's lids were lifted. Her dark eyes looked straight
into those of the older woman.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said quietly, her body relaxing, &quot;I shall not
bungle it.&quot;</p>

<p>William Spantz had been watching her narrowly, even
suspiciously. Now his face cleared.</p>

<p>&quot;She will not fail,&quot; he announced calmly. &quot;Let there
be no apprehension. She is the daughter of a martyr.
Her blood is his. It will flow in the same cause. Sit
down, Olga, my dear. We will not touch upon this
subject again&mdash;until&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, uncle,&quot; she said quietly, resuming her seat
and her attitude of indifference.</p>

<p>The discussion went back to Truxton King. &quot;Isn't it
possible that he is merely attracted by the beauty of
our charming young friend here?&quot; ventured Madame
Drovnask, after many opinions had been advanced respecting
his interest in the shop and its contents. &quot;It
is a habit with Americans, I am told.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Platanova is most worthy of the notice of any
man,&quot; agreed Brutus, with an amiable leer. Olga
seemed to shrink within herself. It was plain that she
was not a kindred spirit to these vicious natures.</p>

<p>&quot;It is part of his game,&quot; said Julius Spantz. &quot;He
knows Olga's past; he is waiting for a chance to catch
her off her guard. He may even go so far as to make
pretty love to you, cousin, in the hope that&mdash;no offence,
my dear, no offence!&quot; Her look had silenced him.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. King is not a spy,&quot; she said steadily.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; concluded William Spantz, &quot;we are safe if
we take no chances with him. He must be watched all
the time. If we discover that he is what some of us
think he is, there is a way to end his usefulness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let him keep away from the shop downstairs,&quot; said
Peter Brutus, with a sidelong glance at the delicate
profile of the girl down the table.</p>

<p>She smiled suddenly, to the amazement of her sinister
companions.</p>

<p>&quot;Have no fear, Brutus. When he hears that you
object, he will be very polite and give us a wide berth,&quot;
she said. Peter flushed angrily.</p>

<p>&quot;He doesn't mean any good by you,&quot; he snapped.
&quot;He'll fool you and&mdash;poof! Away he goes, rejoicing.&quot;</p>

<p>She still smiled. &quot;You have a very good opinion of
me, Peter Brutus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; doggedly, &quot;you know what men of his type
think of shopgirls. They consider them legitimate
prey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what, pray, do men of your type think of us?&quot;
she asked quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough of this,&quot; interposed William Spantz. &quot;Now,
Brutus, what does Count Marlanx say to this day two
weeks? Will he be ready? On that day the Prince and
the Court are to witness the unveiling of the Yetive
memorial statue in the Plaza. It is a full holiday in
Graustark. No man will be employed at his usual task
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Brutus interrupted him. &quot;That is the very day that
the Count has asked me to submit to the Committee.
He believes it to be the day of all days. Nothing should
go amiss. We conquer with a single blow. By noon
of that day, the 26th of July, the Committee of Ten
will be in control of the State; the new regime will be
at hand. A new world will be begun, with Edelweiss as
the centre, about which all the rest shall revolve. We&mdash;the
Committee of Ten&mdash;will be its true founders. We
shall be glorified forever&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've heard all this before, Brutus,&quot; said Julius
Spantz unfeelingly, &quot;a hundred times. It's talk, talk,
talk! What we need now is action. Are we sure that
the Count will be prepared to do all that he says he
will on the 26th of July? Will he have his plans perfected?
Are his forces ready for the stroke?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Positively. They await the word. That's all I can
say,&quot; growled Peter. &quot;The death of the Prince is the
signal for the overthrow of the present government and
the establishment of the new order of equal humanity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all,&quot; mused Julius, Master-at-arms in the
Castle, &quot;it is more humane to slay the Prince while he
is young. It saves him from a long life of trouble and
fear and the constant dread of the very thing that is to
happen to him now. Yes, it is best that it should come
soon.&quot; Down in his heart, Julius loved the little Prince.</p>

<p>For an hour longer the Committee discussed plans for
the eventful day. Certain details were left for future
deliberations; each person had his part to play and
each one was settled in his or her determination that
nothing should go amiss.</p>

<p>The man they feared was Dangloss. They did not
fear God!</p>

<p>When they dispersed for the night, it was to meet
again three days hence for the final word from Marlanx,
who, it seems, was not so far away that communication
with him was likely to be delayed. A sword hung over
the head of Truxton King, an innocent outsider, and
there was a prospect that it would fall in advance of
the blow that was intended to startle the world. Olga
Platanova was the only one who did not look upon the
sprightly American as a spy in the employ of the
government&mdash;a dangerously clever spy at that.</p>

<p>Up in the distant hills slept the Iron Count, dreaming
of the day when he should rule over the new Graustark&mdash;for
he would rule!&mdash;a smile on his grizzled face in
reflection of recent waking thoughts concerning the
punishment that should fall swiftly upon the assassins
of the beloved Prince Robin.</p>

<p>He would make short shrift of assassins!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI" />CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>INGOMEDE THE BEAUTIFUL</h3>


<p>A light, chilling drizzle had been falling all evening,
pattering softly upon the roof of leaves that covered
the sidewalks along Castle Avenue, glistening on the
lamp-lit pavements and blowing ever so gently in the
faces of those who walked in the dripping shades. Far
back from the shimmering sidewalks, surrounded by the
blackest of shadows, and approached by hedge-bordered
paths and driveways, stood the mansions occupied by
the nobility of this gay little kingdom. A score or more
of ancient palaces, in which the spirit, of modern aggression
had wrought interior changes but had left the exteriors
untouched, formed this aristocratic line of
homes. Here were houses that had been built in the
fifteenth century,&mdash;great, square, solemn-looking structures,
grown grey and green with age.</p>

<p>There were lights in a thousand windows along this
misty, royal road&mdash;lights that reflected the pleasures
of the rich and yet caused no envy in time hearts of the
loyal poor.</p>

<p>Almost in the centre of the imposing line stood the
home of the Duke of Perse, Minister of Finance, flanked
on either side by structures as grim and as gay as
itself, yet far less significant in their generation. Here
dwelt the most important man in the principality, not
excepting the devoted prime minister himself. Not that
Perse was so well beloved, but that he held the destinies
of the land in Midas-like fingers. More than that, he
was the father of the far-famed Countess Marlanx, the
most glorious beauty at the Austrian and Russian
courts. She had gone forth from Graustark as its most
notable bride since the wedding day of the Princess
Yetive, late in the nineties. Ingomede, the beautiful, had
journeyed far to the hymeneal altar; the husband who
claimed her was a hated, dishonoured man in his own
land. They were married in Buda Pesth. All Europe
pitied her at the time; there was but one form of prophecy
as to her future. There were those who went so
far as to say that her father had delivered her into the
hands of a latter-day Bluebeard, who whisked her off
into the highlands many leagues from Vienna.</p>

<p>She was seen no more in the gay courts for a year.
Then, of a sudden, she appeared before them all, as
dazzlingly beautiful as ever, but with a haunting, wistful
look in her dark eyes that could not be mistaken.
The old Count found an uneasy delight in exhibiting
her to the world once more, plainly as a bit of property
that all men were expected to look upon with envy
in their hearts. She came up out of the sombre
hills, freed from what must have been nothing less than
captivity in that once feudal castle, to prove to his
world that she thrived in spite of prophetic babblers.
They danced from court to court, grotesquely mis-mated,
deceiving no one as to the true relations that
existed between them. She despised him without concealment;
he took pride in showing that he could best
resent her attitude by the most scrupulous devotion, so
marked that its intent could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>Then the Duke of Perse resumed his residence in Edelweiss,
opening the old palace once more to the world.
His daughter, after the death of the Princess, began her
extended visits to the home of her girlhood. So long as
the Princess was alive she remained away from Edelweiss,
reluctant to meet the friend who had banished
her husband long before the wedding day in Buda Pesth.
Now she came frequently and stayed for weeks at a time,
apparently happy during these escapes from life in the
great capitals. Here, at least, she was free from the
grim old man whose countess she was; here, all was
sweet and warm and friendly, delicious contrast to the
cold, bitter life she knew on the Danube.</p>

<p>Without warning she came and without farewells she
left Edelweiss on the occasion of these periodical visits.
No word was ever spoken concerning her husband, except
on the rare occasions when she opened her heart to
the father who had bartered her into slavery for the
sake of certain social franchises that the Iron Count
had at his disposal. The outside world, which loved her,
never heard of these bitter passages between father and
child. Like Cinderella, she sometimes disappeared from
joyous things at midnight; the next heard of her, she
was in Vienna, or at Schloss Marlanx.</p>

<p>If the Duke of Perse repented of his bargain in giving
his daughter to the Iron Count, he was never known to
intimate as much. He loved Ingomede in his own, hard
way. No doubt he was sorry for her. It is a fact that
she was sorry for him. She could read his bitter
thoughts more clearly than he suspected.</p>

<p>Of late she came more frequently to Edelweiss than
before. She was seen often at the Castle; no court
function was complete without the presence of this
lovely noblewoman; no <i>salon</i> worth while unless graced
by her wit and her beauty.</p>

<p>John Tullis was always to remember the moment when
he looked upon this exquisite creature for the first time.
That was months ago. After that he never ceased
being a secret, silent worshipper at her transient shrine.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock on this rainy night: A carriage has
drawn up before the lower gates to the Perse grounds,
and a tall, shadowy figure leaves it to hurry through the
shrub lined walks to the massive doors. A watchman in
the garden salutes him. The tall figure dips his umbrella
in response, characteristically laconic. A footman
lifts his hand to his forelock at the top of the steps
and throws open the doors without question. This
visitor is expected, it is plain to be seen; a circumstance
which may or may not explain the nervousness that attends
him as he crosses the broad hall toward the
library.</p>

<p>Tullis had long since ceased to be a welcome visitor in
the home of the Duke of Perse. The men were openly
unfriendly to each other. The Duke resented the cool
interference of the sandy-haired American; on the
other hand, Tullis made no effort to conceal his dislike,
if not distrust, of the older man. He argued&mdash;with
unofficial and somewhat personal authority,&mdash;that a
man who could trade his only child for selfish ends
might also be impelled to sacrifice his country's interests
without cramping his conscience.</p>

<p>The Countess was alone in the long, warm-tinted
library. She stood before the dying embers in the
huge old fireplace, her foot upon one of the great iron
dogs. Her smiling face was turned toward the door as
he entered.</p>

<p>&quot;It is good of you to come,&quot; she said, as they shook
hands warmly. &quot;Do you know it is almost a year since
you last came to this house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be a century, Countess, if I were not welcomed
in other houses where I am sure of a glimpse of
you from time to time and a word now and then. Still,
a year's a year. The room hasn't changed so far as I
can see. The same old tiger-skin there, the rugs, the
books, the pictures&mdash;the leopard's skin here and the&mdash;yes,
the lamp is just where it used to be. 'Pon my
soul, I believe you are standing just as you were when
I last saw you here. It's uncanny. One might think
you had not moved in all these months!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or that it has been a minute instead of a year,&quot; she
supplemented. His quick, involuntary glance about him
did not escape her understanding. &quot;The Duke has gone
to Ganlook to play Bridge with friends,&quot; she said at
once. &quot;He will not return till late. I have just telephoned&mdash;to
make sure.&quot; Her smile did more than to
reassure him.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, you will understand how impossible it is
for me to come here, Countess. Your father, the Duke,
doesn't mince matters, and I'm not quite a fool.&quot; Tullis
squinted at the fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think ill of me for asking you to come
to-night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; he said cheerfully, &quot;so long as you are
quite sure that your father is in Ganlook. He would
be perfectly justified in kicking me out if he were to
catch me here. And as I'm rather cumbersome and
he's somewhat venerable, I don't like to think of the
jar it would be to his system. But, so long as he isn't
here, and I am, why shouldn't I draw up a chair before
the fire for you, and another for myself, with the
cigarettes and a world between us, to discuss conditions
as they are, not as they might be if we were discovered?
Shall I? Good! I defy any one's father to get me out
of this chair until I am ready to relinquish it voluntarily.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you superintended the 'going-to-bed' of
Prince Robin before you left the Castle?&quot; she said, lying
back in the comfortable chair and stretching her
feet out to the fire. He handed her a match and watched
her light the long, ridiculously thin cigarette.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I never miss it, Countess. The last thing he
does, after saying his prayers, is to recall me from
exile. He wouldn't be happy if he couldn't do that.
He says amen and hops into bed. Then he grins in a
far from imperial way and announces that he's willing
to give me another chance, and please won't I tell him
the latest news concerning Jack-the-giant-killer. He
asked me to-night if I thought you'd mind if he
banished your father. They've had a children's quarrel,
I believe. If you do mind, I am to let him know: he
won't banish him. He's very fond of you, Countess.&quot;
She laughed gaily.</p>

<p>&quot;He is a dear boy. I adore him. I think I quite
understand why you are giving up your life to him. At
first I wasn't sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You thought I expected to gain something by it, is
not that so? Well, there are a great many people who
think so still&mdash;your father among them. They'll never
understand. I don't blame them, for, I declare to you,
I don't fully appreciate it myself. John Tullis playing
nurse and story-teller to a seven-year-old boy, to the
exclusion of everything else, is more than I can grasp.
Somehow, I've come to feel that he's mine. That must
be the reason. But you've heard me prate on this subject
a hundred times. Don't let me start it again.
There's something else you want to talk to me about,
so please don't encourage me to tell all the wonderful
things he has said and done to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is of the Prince that I want to speak, Mr. Tullis,&quot;
she said, suddenly serious. &quot;I don't care to hear
whether he stubbed his toe to-day or just how much he
has grown since yesterday, but I do want to talk very
seriously with you concerning his future&mdash;I might say
his immediate future.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at her narrowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you quite serious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite. I could not have asked you to come to this
house for anything trivial. We have become very good
friends, you and I. Too good, perhaps, for I've no
doubt there are old tabbies in Edelweiss who are provoked
to criticism&mdash;you know what I mean. Their
world is full of imaginary affairs, else what would there
be left for old age? But we are good friends and we
understand why we are good friends, so there's the end
to that. As I say, I could not have asked so true a
friend into the house of his enemy for the mere sake
of having my vanity pleased by his obedience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am quite sure of that,&quot; he said. &quot;Are you in
trouble, Countess? Is there anything I can do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It has to do with the Prince, not with me,&quot; she said.
&quot;And yet I am in trouble&mdash;or perhaps I should say, I
am troubled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Prince is a sturdy little beggar,&quot; he began, but
she lifted her hand in protest.</p>

<p>&quot;And he has sturdy, loyal friends. That is agreed.
And yet&mdash;&quot; she paused, a perplexed line coming between
her expressive eyes.</p>

<p>John Tullis opened his own eyes very wide. &quot;You
don't mean to say that he is&mdash;he is in peril of any sort?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked at him a long time before speaking. He
could feel that she was turning something over in her
mind before giving utterance to the thought.</p>

<p>At last she leaned nearer to him, dropping the ash
from her cigarette into the receiver as she spoke slowly,
intensely. &quot;I think he is in peril&mdash;in deadly peril.&quot;</p>

<p>He stared hard. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he demanded,
with an involuntary glance over his shoulder. She interpreted
that glance correctly.</p>

<p>&quot;The peril is not here, Mr. Tullis. I know what you
are thinking. My father is a loyal subject. The peril
I suggest never comes to Graustark.&quot;</p>

<p>She said no more but leaned forward, her face whiter
than its wont. He frowned, but it was the effect of
temporary perplexity. Gradually the meaning of her
simple, though significant remark filtered through his
brain.</p>

<p>&quot;Never comes to Graustark?&quot; he almost whispered.
&quot;You don't&mdash;you can't mean your&mdash;your husband?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean Count Marlanx,&quot; she said steadily.</p>

<p>&quot;He means evil to Prince Robin? Good Heavens,
Countess, I&mdash;I can't believe it. I know he is bitter,
revengeful, and all that, but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is all that and more,&quot; she said. &quot;First, you must
let me impress you that I am not a traitor to his cause.
I could not be that, for the sufficient reason that I only
suspect its existence. I am not in any sense a part of it.
I do not <i>know</i> anything. I only feel. I dare say you
realise that I do not love Count Marlanx&mdash;that there is
absolutely nothing in common between us except a
name. We won't go into that. I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am overjoyed to hear you say this, Countess,&quot; he
said very seriously. &quot;I have been so bold on occasion
as to assert&mdash;for your private ear, of course&mdash;that you
could not, by any freak of nature, happen to care for
Count Marlanx, whom I know only by description. You
have laughed at my so-called American wit, and you
have been most tolerant. Now, I feel that I am justified.
I'm immeasurably glad to hear you confess that you do
not love your husband.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot imagine any one so stupid as to think that
I do love Count Marlanx, for that matter, that he
loves me. Still, I am relieved to hear you say that you
are glad. It simplifies the present for us, and that is
what we are to discuss.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are very, very beautiful, and young, and unhappy,&quot;
he said irrelevantly, a darker glow in his
cheeks. She smiled serenely, without a trace of diffidence
or protest.</p>

<p>&quot;I can almost believe it, you say it so convincingly,&quot;
she said. For a moment she relaxed luxuriantly into
an attitude of physical enjoyment of herself, surveying
her toe-tips with a thoughtfulness that comprehended
more; and then as abruptly came back to the business
of the moment. &quot;You must not spoil it all by saying
it too fervently,&quot; she went on with a smile of warning.
He gave a short laugh of confusion and sank back in
the chair.</p>

<p>&quot;You have never tried to make love to me,&quot; she went
on. &quot;That's what I like about you. I think most men
are silly, not because I am so very young, but because
my husband is so ridiculously old. Don't you think so?
But, never mind! I see you are quite eager to answer&mdash;that's
enough. Take another cigarette and&mdash;listen to
what I am going to say.&quot; He declined the cigarette
with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>After a moment she went on resolutely: &quot;As I said
before, I do not know that my suspicions are correct.
I have not even breathed them to my father. He would
have laughed at me. My husband is a Graustarkian,
even as I am, but there is this distinction between us:
he despises Graustark, while I love her in every drop of
my blood. I know that in his heart he has never ceased
to brew evil for the throne that disgraced him. He
openly expresses his hatred for the present dynasty,
and has more than once said in public gatherings that
he could cheerfully assist in its utter destruction. That,
of course, is commonly known in Graustark, where he is
scorned and derided. But he is not a man to serve his
hatred with mere idle words and inaction.&quot; She stopped
for a moment, and then cried impulsively: &quot;I must
first know that you will not consider me base and disloyal
in saying these things to you. After all, he is
my husband.&quot;</p>

<p>He saw the faint curl of her lip. &quot;Before that,&quot; he
argued simply, &quot;you were a daughter of Graustark.
You were not born to serve a cause that means evil to
the dear land. Graustark first made you noble; you
can't go back on that, you know. Don't let your husband
degrade you. I think you can see how I feel about
it. Please believe that I know you can do no wrong.&quot;</p>

<br />
</div>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, returning the look in his
earnest grey eyes with one in which the utmost confidence
shone. &quot;You are the only man to whom I feel
sure that I can reveal myself and be quite understood.
It isn't as if I had positive facts to divulge, for I have
not; they are suspicions, fears, that's all, but they are
no longer vague shapes to me; they mean something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; he said quietly. He seemed to square his
broad shoulders and to set his jaw firmly, as if to resist
physical attack. She knew she had come with her fears
to a man in whose face it was declared that he could
laugh at substance as well as shadow.</p>

<p>&quot;I am seeing you here in this big room, openly, for the
simple reason that if I am being watched this manner
of meeting may be above suspicion. We may speak
freely here, for we cannot be heard unless we raise our
voices. Don't betray surprise or consternation. The
eyes of the wall may be better than its ears.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't mean to say you are being watched here in
your father's house?&quot; he demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. This I do know: the Count has many
spies in Edelweiss. He is systematically apprised of
everything that occurs at court, in the city, or in the
council chamber. So you see, he is being well served,
whether to an evil purpose or to satisfy his own innate
curiosity, I do not know. He has reports almost daily,&mdash;voluminous
things, partly in cipher, partly free, and
he is forever sending men away on secret, mysterious missions.
Understand, I do not know that he is actually
planning disaster to Graustark. Day before yesterday I
saw his secretary in the streets&mdash;a man who has been in
his employ for five years or more and who now pretends
to be a lawyer here. His name is Brutus. I spoke with
him. He said that he had left the Count six weeks ago
in Vienna, determined to set out for himself in his chosen
profession. He knows, of course, that I am not and
never have been in the confidences of my husband. I
asked him if it was known in Edelweiss that he had
served the Count as secretary. He promptly handed
me one of his business cards, on which he refers to himself
as the former trusted and confidential secretary of
Count Marlanx. Now, I happen to know that he is still
in my husband's service,&mdash;or was no longer ago than
last week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Countess, he may be serving him legitimately
as an attorney. There would be nothing strange in
that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he is still serving him as confidential secretary.
He is here for a purpose, as my husband's representative.
I have not been asleep all these months at Schloss
Marlanx. I have seen and heard enough to convince
me that some great movement is on foot. My intelligence
tells me that it has to do with Graustark. As he
wishes the Prince no good, it must be for evil.&quot;
&quot;But there is nothing he can do. He has no following
here. The Prince is adored by the people. Count
Marlanx would not be such a fool as to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is no fool,&quot; she interrupted quickly. &quot;That's
why I am afraid. If he is plotting against the Crown,
you may depend upon it he is laying his plans well.
John Tullis, that man is a devil&mdash;a devil incarnate.&quot;
She turned her face away.</p>

<p>A spasm of utter repugnance crossed her face; she
shuddered so violently that his hand went forth to
clutch the fingers that trembled on the arm of the chair.
He held them in his firm grasp for a moment. They
looked into each other's eyes and he saw the flicker of
undisguised horror in hers. An instant later she was
herself again. Withdrawing her hand, she added, with
a short laugh of derision: &quot;Still I did not expect
heaven, so why complain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you are an angel,&quot; he blurted out.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe the Count will agree to that,&quot; she
said, with a reflective twinkle in her dark eyes. &quot;He
has not found me especially angelic. If you imagine
that I cannot scratch back, my dear friend, you are
very much mistaken. I have had the pleasure of giving
him more than one bad half hour. You may be sure
he has never called me an angel. Quite the other thing,
I assure you. But we are straying from the point.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a moment, please,&quot; he commanded. &quot;I want to
say to you here and now: you are the gentlest, loveliest
woman I have ever known. I don't say it idly. I mean
it. If you gave him half as good as he sent, I rejoice
in your spirit. Now, I want to ask if you expect to
go back to live with the da&mdash;with him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That, Mr. Tullis, is hardly a matter I can discuss
with you,&quot; she said gently, and he was not offended.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps not, Countess, but now is the time for you
to decide the issue. Why should you return to Castle
Marlanx? Why keep up the farce&mdash;or I might say,
tragedy&mdash;any longer? You love Graustark. You love
the Prince. You betray them both by consorting with
their harshest foe. Oh, I could tell you a thousand
reasons why&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We haven't time for them,&quot; she interrupted, with
mock despair in her face. &quot;Besides, I said we cannot
discuss it. It requires no learned argument to move
me, one way or the other. I can decide for myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should divorce him,&quot; he said harshly.</p>

<p>She laughed easily, softly. &quot;My good friend, if I
did that, I'd lose your friendship.&quot; He opened his lips
to remonstrate, but suddenly caught the undercurrent
of the naive remark.</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove,&quot; he said, his eyes glowing, &quot;you must not
risk finding me too obtuse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bravo!&quot; she cried. &quot;You are improving.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could provide a splendid substitute for the friendship
you speak of,&quot; he said coolly.</p>

<p>&quot;Poof! What is that to me? I could have a hundred
lovers&mdash;but, ach, friends are the scarcest things in the
world. I prefer friendship. It lasts. There! I see
disapproval in your face! You Americans are so
literal.&quot; She gazed into the fireplace for a moment,
her lips parted in a whimsical smile. He waited for her
to go on; the words were on her tongue's end, he could
tell. &quot;A divorce at twenty-five. I believe that is the
accepted age, isn't it? If one gets beyond that, she&mdash;but,
enough of this!&quot; She sprang to her feet and stood
before him, the flash dying in her eyes even as it was
born that he might see so briefly. &quot;We diverge! You
must go soon. It is best not to be seen leaving here at
a very late hour&mdash;especially as my father is known to
be away. I am afraid of Peter Brutus. He is here to
watch&mdash;<i>everybody</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>She was leaning against the great carved mantel post,
a tall, slender, lissome creature, exquisitely gowned in
rarest Irish lace, her bare neck and shoulders gleaming
white against the dull timbers beyond, the faint glow
from the embers creeping up to her face with the insistence
of a maiden's flush. He gazed in rapt admiration,
his heart thumping like fury in his great breast.
She was little more than a girl, this wife of old Marlanx,
and yet how wise, how clever, how brilliant she was!</p>

<p>A face of unusual pallor and extremely patrician in
its modelling, surmounted by a coiffure so black that it
could be compared only to ebony&mdash;black and almost
gleaming with the life that was in it. It came low on
her forehead, shading the wondrous dark eyes&mdash;eyes
that were a deep yellowish green in their division between
grey and black, eyes that were soft and luminous
and unwaveringly steadfast, impelling in their power to
fascinate, yet even more dangerously compassionate
when put to the test that tries woman's vanity.</p>

<p>There were diamonds on her long, tapering fingers, and
a rope of pearls in her hair. A single wide gold band
encircled her arm above the elbow, an arm-band as old
as the principality itself, for it had been worn by
twenty fair ancestors before her. The noblewomen of
Graustark never wore bracelets on their wrists; always
the wide chased gold band on the upper arm. There
was a day, not so far back in history, when they wore
bands on their ankles.</p>

<p>She was well named Ingomede, the Beautiful.</p>

<p>A soft, almost imperceptible perfume, languorous in
its appeal to the senses, exuded from this perfect creation;
added to this, the subtle, unfailing scent of young
womanhood; the warm, alive feel of her presence in the
atmosphere; a suggestion of something sensuous, clean,
pure, delicious. The undescribable.</p>

<p>&quot;Does Baron Dangloss know this man Brutus?&quot;
asked Tullis, arising to stand beside her. A sub-conscious,
triumphant thrill shot through him as an instantaneous
flash of his own physical superiority over
this girl's husband came over him. He was young and
strong and vital. He could feel the sensation of being
strong; he tingled with the glory of it. He was
thirty-five, Marlanx seventy. He wondered if
Marlanx had ever been as strong as he.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; she said thoughtfully. &quot;I have not
spoken to him concerning Brutus. Perhaps he knows.
The Baron is very wise. Let me tell you how I happen
to know that Peter Brutus is still serving Count
Marlanx and why I think his presence signifies a crisis
of some sort.&quot; Tullis stood facing the great fireplace,
his back to the hail. He observed that she looked
toward the doors quite as often as she looked at him;
it struck him that she was extremely cautious despite
her apparent ease.</p>

<p>Her voice, always low and even, second lower still.
&quot;In the first place, I have a faithful friend in one of
the oldest retainers at Schloss Marlanx. His daughter
is my maid. She is here with me now. The old man
came to see Josepha one day last week. He had accompanied
Count Marlanx to the town of Balak, which
is in Axphain, a mile beyond the Graustark line. Peter
Brutus was with my husband in Balak for two days.
They were closeted together from morning till night in
the house where Marlanx was stopping. At the end
of two days Brutus went away, but he carried with him
a vast sum of money provided by my husband. It was
given out that he was on his way to Serros in Dawsbergen,
where he expected to purchase a business block
for his master. Marlanx waited another day in Balak,
permitting Josepha's father to come on to Edelweiss
with a message for me and to see his daughter. He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Josepha's father saw Brutus in Edelweiss?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. But he did see him going into Balak as he left
for Edelweiss that morning. He wore a disguise, but
Jacob says he could not be mistaken. Moreover, he was accompanied
by several men whom he recognised as Graustark
mountaineers and hunters of rather unsavoury
reputation. They left Brutus at the gates of Balak
and went off into the hills. All this happened before I
knew that Peter was living in Edelweiss. When I saw
him here, I knew at once that his presence meant something
sinister. I can put many things together that
once puzzled me&mdash;the comings and goings of months,
the secret reports and consultations, the queer looking
men who came to the Castle, the long absences of my
husband and my&mdash;my own virtual imprisonment&mdash;yes,
imprisonment. I was not permitted to leave the castle
for days at a time during his absences.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Surely you will not go back again&quot;&mdash;he began hotly.</p>

<p>&quot;Sh!&quot; She put a finger to her lips. A man-servant
was quietly crossing the hall just off the library. &quot;He
is a new man. I do not like his appearance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think he heard us or observed anything? I
can make short work of him if&mdash;&quot; He paused significantly.
She smiled up into his face.</p>

<p>&quot;He did not hear anything. We've frightened him
off, if he intended to play the eavesdropper.&quot; The
servant had disappeared through a door at the end of
the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Then there were the great sums of money that my
husband sent off from time to time, and the strange
boxes that came overland to the castle and later went
away again as secretly as they came. Mr. Tullis, I am
confident in my mind that those boxes contained firearms
and ammunition. I have thought it all out. Perhaps
I am wrong, but it seems to me that I can almost
see those firearms stored away in the caves and cabins
outside of Edelweiss, ready for instant use when the
signal comes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God! An uprising? A plot so huge as that?&quot; he
gasped, amazed. It is fortunate that he was not facing
the door; the same servant, passing once more, might
have seen the tell-tale consternation in his eyes. &quot;It
cannot be possible! Why, Dangloss and his men would
have scented it long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have not said that I am sure of anything, remember
that. I leave it to you to analyse. You have the
foundation on which to work. I'd advise you to waste
no time. Something tells me that the crisis is near at
hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should Josepha's father tell these things to
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because, if you will pardon my frankness, I have
protected his daughter against Count Marlanx. He
understands. And yet he would not betray a trust imposed
upon him even by the Count. He has only told
me what any one else might have seen with his own
eyes. Wait! The new servant is in the hall again.&quot;
She clapped her hands sharply and called out &quot;Franz!&quot;</p>

<p>The new man appeared in the doorway almost on the
instant. &quot;You may replenish the fire, Franz.&quot; The
man, a sallow, precise fellow, crossed deliberately and
poked the half dead fire; with scrupulous care he selected
two great chunks of wood from the hopper near
by and laid them on the coals, the others watching his
movements with curious interest. There was nothing
about the fellow to indicate that he was other than what
he pretended to be.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it strange that we should have fires in July?&quot;
she asked casually. &quot;The mountain air and the night
fogs make it absolutely necessary in these big old
houses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We had a jolly fire in the Prince's room when I left
the Castle. Our monarch is subject to croup, you see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is all, Franz.&quot; The man bowed and left the
room. &quot;What do you think of him?&quot; she asked, after a
moment.</p>

<p>&quot;He has a very bad liver,&quot; was all Tullis deigned to offer
in response. The Countess stared for a moment and
then laughed understandingly. &quot;I think he needs a
change.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a strange feeling that he is but one of a great
many men who are in Edelweiss for the purposes I mentioned
before. Now I have a favour to ask of you. Will
you take this matter up with Baron Dangloss as if on
your own initiative? Do not mention me in any way.
You can understand why I ask this of you. Let them
believe that the suspicions are yours. I trust you to
present them without involving me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trust me, my dear Countess. I am a very diplomatic
liar. You need have no fear. I shall find a quick way
of getting my friend Dangloss on the right track. It
may be a wild goose chase, but it is best to be on the safe
side. May I now tell you how greatly I appreciate your
confidence in&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>She stopped him with a glance. &quot;No, you may not tell
me. There is nothing more to be said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I understand,&quot; he said gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us change the subject. I have uttered my word
to the wise. Eh bien! It may not be so bad as I think.
Let us hope so, at least.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a vague notion that you'd rejoice if we should
catch your ogre and chop his head off,&quot; said he, coolly
lighting a fresh cigarette. She liked his assurance. He
was not like other men.</p>

<p>Glancing up at his sandy thatch, she said, with a rueful
droop at the corners of her mouth, a contradictory smile
in her eyes: &quot;I shall rejoice more if you do not lose
your head afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Double entendre</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought, perhaps, you referred to an unhappy
plight that already casts its shadow before,&quot; he said
boldly. &quot;I may lose everything else, my dear Countess,
but <i>not</i> my head.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you,&quot; she said, strangely serious. &quot;I shall
remember that.&quot;</p>

<p>She knew this man loved her.</p>

<p>&quot;Sit down, now, and let us be comfy. We are quite
alone,&quot; she added instantly, a sudden confusion coming
over her. &quot;First, will you give me that box of candy
from the table? Thank you so much for sending it to
me. How in the world do you manage to get this wonderful
New York candy all the way to Graustark? It is
quite fresh and perfectly delicious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Fifth Avenue isn't so far away as you think,&quot;
he equivocated. &quot;It's just around the corner&mdash;of the
world. What's eight or nine thousand miles to a
district messenger boy? I ring for one and he fetches
the candy, before you can wink your eye or say Jack
Robinson. It's a marvellous system.&quot;</p>

<p>He watched her white teeth set themselves daintily in
the rich nougat; then the red lips closed tranquilly only
to open again in a smile of rapture. For reasons best
known to himself, he chose not to risk losing the thing
he had vowed not to lose. He turned his head&mdash;and
carefully inspected the end of his cigarette. A wholly
unnecessary precaution, as any one might have seen that
it was behaving beautifully.</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed ever so slightly as she studied his
averted face in that brief instant. When he turned to
her again, she was resting her head against the back of
the chair, and her eyes were closed as if in exquisite enjoyment
of the morsel that lay behind her smiling lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you enjoying it?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Tremendously,&quot; she replied, opening her eyes slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;'Gad, I believe you are,&quot; he exclaimed. She sat up
at once, and caught her breath, although he did not
know it. His smile distinctly upset her tranquillity.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way,&quot; he added, as if dismissing the matter,
&quot;have you forgotten that on Tuesday we go to the
Witch's hut in the hills? Bobby has dingdonged it into
me for days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be good fun,&quot; she said. Then, as a swift afterthought:

<h3>AT THE WITCH'S HUT</h3>


<p>The next morning, before setting forth to consult the
minister of police at the Tower, he called up the Perse
palace on the telephone and asked for the Countess, to
tell her in so many words that he had been followed from
her door to the very gates of the Castle grounds. Not
by one man alone, for that would have excited suspicion,
but by half a dozen at least, each one taking up the
surveillance in the most casual manner as the watcher
before him left off. Tullis was amazed by the cunning
which masked these proceedings; there was a wily brain
behind it.</p>

<p>The Duke's secretary answered the call. Tullis was
completely bowled over by the curt information that the
Countess Marlanx had left Edelweiss before six that
morning, to join her husband, who was shooting wild
boars with a party in Axphain.</p>

<p>&quot;When does she return?&quot; demanded the American,
scarcely believing his ears. She had said nothing of
this the night before. What could it mean?</p>

<p>&quot;I do not know, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In a day or two?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She took sixteen trunks, sir,&quot; was the laconic reply,
as if that told the story in full.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm damned!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg pardon, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg <i>your</i> pardon. Good morning.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the meantime, our excellent young friend, Truxton
King, was having a sorry time of it. It all began when
he went to the Cathedral in the hope of seeing the charming
aunt of the little Prince once more. Not only did
he attend one service, but all of them, having been
assured that the royal family worshipped there quite as
regularly and as religiously as the lowliest communicant.
She did not appear.</p>

<p>More than all this, he met with fresh disappointment
when he ambled down to the armourer's shop. The
doors were locked and there was no sign of life about
the shuttered place. The caf&eacute;s were closed on this day
of rest, so there was nothing left for him to do but to
slink off to his room in the Regengetz, there to read or
to play solitaire and to curse the progress of civilisation.</p>

<p>Monday was little better than Sunday. Hobbs positively
refused to escort him to the Castle grounds again.
No amount of bribing or browbeating could move the
confounded Englishman from his stand. He was willing
to take him anywhere else, but never again would he risk
a personally conducted tour into hot waters royal. Mr.
King resigned himself to a purely business call at the
shop of Mr. Spantz. He looked long, with a somewhat
shifty eye, at the cabinet of ancient rings and necklaces,
and then departed without having seen the interesting
Miss Platanova. If the old man observed a tendency
to roam in the young man's eye, he did not betray the
fact&mdash;at least not so that any one could notice. Truxton
departed, but returned immediately after luncheon,
vaguely inclined to decide between two desirable rings.
After a protracted period of indecision, in which Olga
remained stubbornly out of sight, he announced that he
could not make up his mind, and would return later for
another inspection.</p>

<p>At his room in the hotel, he found a note addressed to
himself. It did not have much to say, but it meant a
great deal. There was no signature, and the handwriting
was that of a woman.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Please do not come again</i>.&quot; That was all.</p>

<p>He laughed with a fine tone of defiance and&mdash;went back
to the shop at five o'clock, just to prove that nothing
so timid as a note could stop him. This, however, was
after he had taken a long walk down Castle Avenue,
with a supplementary stroll of little incident outside the
grim, high walls that enclosed the grounds. If any one
had told him that he was secretly hoping to find a crevasse
through which he could invade paradise, I make
no doubt he would have resented the imputation soundly.
On the occasion of this last visit to the shop, he did not
stay long, but went away somewhat dazed to find himself
the possessor of a ring he did not want and out of
pocket just thirty dollars, American. Having come to
the conclusion that knight-errantry of that kind was not
only profligate but distinctly irritating to his sense of
humour, he looked up Mr. Hobbs and arranged for a
day's ride in the mountains.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll oblige me, Mr. Hobbs, by removing that band
from your cap. I know you're an interpreter. It's an
insult to my intelligence to have it flaunted in my face
all day long. I'll admit you're what you say you are,
so take it off before we start out to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>And so, minus the beguiling insignia of office, Mr. Hobbs
led his hypercritical patron into the mountain roads
early the next morning, both well mounted and provided
with a luncheon large enough to restore the amiability
that was sure to flag at mid-day unless sustained by
un&aelig;sthetic sandwiches and beer.</p>

<p>The day was bright and clear, warm in the valley where
the city lay, cooler to cold as one mounted the winding
roads that led past the lofty Monastery of St. Valentine,
sombre sentinel among the clouds.</p>

<p>A part of Edelweiss is built along the side of the mountain,
its narrow streets winding upward and past countless
terraces to the very base of the rocky, jagged
eminence at whose top, a full mile above the last sprinkling
of houses, stands the isolated, bleak Monastery. The
view from these upper streets, before one enters the
circuitous and hidden Monastery road that winds afar
in its climb, is never to be forgotten by the spectator, no
matter how often he traverses the lofty thoroughfares.
As far as the eye can reach, lies the green valley,
through which winds the silvery river with its evergreen
banks and spotless white houses-greens and whites that
almost shame the vaunted tints of old Ireland as one
views them from the incoming steamers. Immediately
below one's feet lies the compact little city, with its red
roofs and green chimney pots, its narrow streets and
vivid awnings, its wide avenues and the ancient Castle to
the north. To the south, the fortress and the bridges;
encircling the city a thick, high wall with here and
there enormous gates flanked by towers so grim and old
that they seem ready to topple over from the sheer
fatigue of centuries. A soft, Indian summer haze hangs
over the lazy-lit valley; it is always so in the summer
time.</p>

<p>Outside the city walls stretch the wheat-fields and the
meadows, the vineyards and orchards, all snug in the
nest of forest-crowned hills, whose lower slopes are
spotted with broken herds of cattle and the more mobile
flocks of sheep. An air of tranquillity lies low over the
entire vista; one dozes if he looks long into this peaceful
bowl of plenty.</p>

<p>From the distant passes in the mountains to the east
and north come the dull intonations of dynamite blasts,
proving the presence of that disturbing element of progress
which is driving the railroad through the unbroken
heart of the land.</p>

<p>It is a good three hours' ride to the summit of Monastery
Mountain. And, after the height has been attained,
one does not care to linger long among the chilly,
whistling crags, with their snow-crevasses and bitter
winds; the utter loneliness, the aloofness of this frost-crowned
crest appals, disheartens one who loves the fair,
green things of life. In the shelter of the crags, at the
base of the Monastery walls, looking out over the sunlit
valley, one has his luncheon and his snack of spirits
quite undisturbed, for the monks pay no heed to him.
They are not hospitable, neither are they unfriendly.
One seldom sees them.</p>

<p>Truxton King and Mr. Hobbs were not long in disposing
of their lunch. It was too cold for comfort in their
draughty dining-room, and they were not invited to enter
the inhospitable gates. In half an hour they were
wending their way down the north side of the peak by
gradually declining roads, headed for the much-talked-of
home of the Witch in Ganlook Gap, some six miles
from Edelweiss as the crow flies, but twice that distance
over the tortuous bridle paths and post roads.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock when they clattered down the stone
road and up to the forbidding vale in which lurked, like
an evil, guilty thing, the log-built home of that ancient
female who made no secret of her practices in witchcraft.
The hut stood back from the mountain road a
hundred yards or more, at the head of a small, thicket-
grown recess.</p>

<p>A low, thatched roof protruded from the hill against
which the hut was built. As a matter of fact, a thin
chimney grew out of the earth itself, for all the world
like a smoking tree stump. The hovel was a squalid, beggary
thing that might have been built over night somewhere
back in the dark ages. Its single door was so low
that one was obliged to stoop to enter the little room
where the dame had been holding forth for three-score
years, 'twas said. This was her throne-room, her dining-room,
her bed-chamber, her all, it would seem, unless one
had been there before and knew that her kitchen was
beyond, in the side of the hill. The one window, sans
glass, looked narrowly out upon an odd opening in the
foliage below, giving the occupant of the hut an unobstructed
view of the winding road that led up from
Edelweiss. The door faced the Monastery road down
which the two men had just ridden. As for the door
yard, it was no more than a pebbly, avalanche-swept
opening among the trees and rocks, down which in the
glacial age perhaps a thousand torrents had leaped, but
which was now so dry and white and lifeless that one
could only think of bones bleached and polished by a sun
that had sickened of the work a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>This brief, inadequate description of the Witch's hut
is given in advance of the actual descent of the personally
conducted gentleman for the somewhat ambiguous
reason that he was to find it not at all as described.</p>

<p>The two horsemen rode into the glen and came plump
upon a small detachment of the royal guard, mounted
and rather resolute in their lack of amiability.</p>

<p>&quot;Wot's this?&quot; gasped Mr. Hobbs, drawing rein at the
edge of the pebbly dooryard.</p>

<p>&quot;Soldiers, I'd say,&quot; remarked Mr. King, scowling quite
glumly from beneath the rim of his panama. &quot;Hello!&quot;
His eyes brightened and his hat came off with a switch.
&quot;There's the Prince!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My word,&quot; ejaculated Mr. Hobbs, and forthwith began
to ransack his pockets for the band which said he
was from Cook's.</p>

<p>Farther up the glen, in fact at the very door of the
Witch's hut, were gathered a small but rather distinguished
portion of the royal household. It was not
difficult to recognise the little Prince. He was standing
beside John Tullis; and it is not with a desire to speak ill
of his valour that we add: he was clutching the slackest
part of that gentleman's riding breeks with an earnestness
that betrayed extreme trepidation. Facing them,
on the stone door-step, was the Witch herself, a figure
to try the courage of a time-tried hero, let alone the
susceptibilities of a small boy in knickers. Behind
Tullis and the Prince were several ladies and gentlemen,
all in riding garments and all more or less ill at ease.</p>

<p>Truxton King's heart swelled suddenly; all the world
grew bright again for him. Next to the tall figure of
Colonel Quinnox, of the Royal Guard, was the slim,
entrancing lady of his most recent dreams&mdash;the Prince's
aunt! The lady of the grotto! The lady of the goldfish
conspiracy!</p>

<p>The Countess Marlanx, tall and exquisite, was a little
apart from the others, with Baron Dangloss and young
Count Vos Engo&mdash;whom Truxton was ready to hate because
he was a recognised suitor for the hand of the slim,
young person in grey. He thought he had liked her
beyond increase in the rajah silk, but now he confessed
to himself that he was mistaken. He liked her better in
a grey riding habit. It struck him sharply, as he sat
there in the saddle, that she would be absolutely and
adorably faultless in point lace or calico, in silk or
gingham, low-neck or high. He was for riding boldly
up to this little group, but a very objectionable lieutenant
barred the way, supported in no small measure
by the defection of Mr. Hobbs, who announced in a
hoarse, agitated whisper that he's &quot;be 'anged if he'd let
any man make a fool of him twice over.&quot;</p>

<p>The way was made easy by the intervention of the
alert young woman in grey. She caught sight of the
restricted adventurers&mdash;or one of them, to be quite accurate&mdash;and,
after speeding a swift smile of astonishment,
turned quickly to Prince Bobby.</p>

<p>A moment later, the tall stranger with the sun-browned
face was the centre of interest to the small
group at the door. He bowed amiably to the smiling
young person in grey and received a quick nod in response.
As he was adventuring what he considered to
be a proper salute for the Prince, he observed that a few
words passed between the lad's aunt and John Tullis,
who was now surveying him with some interest.</p>

<p>The Prince broke the ice.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; he cried shrilly, his little face aglow.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; responded the gentleman, readily.</p>

<p>John Tullis found himself being dragged away from
the Witch's door toward the newcomer at the bottom of
the glen. Mr. Hobbs listened with deepening awe to the
friendly conversation which resulted in Truxton King
going forward to join the party in front of the hut.
He came along in the rear, after having tethered the
tired horses, not quite sure that he was awake. The
Prince had called him Mr. Cook, had asked him how his
Sons were, all of which was highly gratifying when one
pauses to consider that he had got his cap band on
upside down in his excitement. He always was to wonder
how the little monarch succeeded in reading the title
without standing on his head to do so.</p>

<p>Truxton was duly presented to the ladies and gentlemen
of the party by John Tullis, who gracefully announced
that he knew King's parents in New York.
Baron Dangloss was quite an old friend, if one were to
judge by the manner in which he greeted the young
man. The lady in grey smiled so sweetly and nodded
so blithely, that Tullis, instead of presenting King to
her as he had done to the Countess Marlanx and others,
merely said:</p>

<p>&quot;And you know one another, of course.&quot; Whereupon
she flushed very prettily and felt constrained to avoid
Truxton's look of inquiry. He did not lose his wits,
but vowed acquiescence and assumed that he knew.</p>

<p>As a result of the combined supplications of the entire
party, the old woman grudgingly consented to take
them into her hovel, where, in exchange for small pieces
of silver, she would undertake certain manifestations in
necromancy.</p>

<p>Truxton King, scarcely able to believe his good fortune,
crowded into the loathsome, squalid room with his
aristocratic companions, managing, with considerable
skill, to keep close beside his charming friend. They
stood back while the others crowded up to the table
where the hag occupied herself with the crystal ball.</p>

<p>Never had Truxton looked upon a creature who so
thoroughly vindicated the life-long reliance he had put
in the description of witches given by the fairy-tale
tellers of his earliest youth. She had the traditional
hook-nose and peaked chin, the glittering eyes, the thousand
wrinkles and the toothless gums. He looked about
for the raven and the cat, but if she had them, they
were not in evidence. At a rough guess, he calculated
her age at one hundred years. A youth of extreme
laziness, who Baron Dangloss said was the old woman's
grandson, appeared to be her man-of-all-work. He
fetched the old woman's crystal, placed stools for the
visitors, lighted the candles on the table, occupying no
less than a quarter of an hour in performing these
simple acts, so awkward that at least two of his observers
giggled openly and whispered their opinions.</p>

<p>&quot;Gruesome lady, isn't she?&quot; whispered King.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall dream of her for months,&quot; whispered the lady
in grey, shuddering.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you willing to have her read your future in that
ball?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really think she can tell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I once had a fortune-teller say that I would be married
before I was twenty-three,&quot; he informed her. She appeared
interested.</p>

<p>&quot;And were you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. But she did her part, you know&mdash;the fortune-teller,
I mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She warned you. I see. So it really wasn't her
fault.&quot; She was watching the preparations at the table
with eager eyes, her lips parted and her breath coming
quick through excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you mind telling me how I am to address you?&quot;
whispered King. They were leaning against the mud-plastered
wall near the little window, side by side. The
whimsical smile that every one loved to see was on his
lips, in his eyes. &quot;You see, I'm a stranger in a strange
land. That accounts for my ignorance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must not speak while she is gazing into the
crystal,&quot; she warned, after a quick, searching glance at
his face. He could have sworn that he saw a gleam of
concern in her eyes, followed instantly by a twinkle that
meant mischief.</p>

<p>&quot;Please consider my plight,&quot; he implored. &quot;I can't call
you Aunt Loraine, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed silently and turned her head to devote her
entire attention to the scene at the table. Truxton King
was in a sudden state of trepidation. Had he offended
her? There was a hot rush of blood to his ears. He
missed the sly, wondering glance that she gave him out
of the corner of her eye a moment later.</p>

<p>Although it was broad daylight, the low, stuffy room
would have been pitch dark had it not been for the
flickering candles on the table beside the bent, grey head
of the mumbling fortune-teller, whose bony fingers
twitched over and about the crystal globe like wiggling
serpents' tails. The window gave little or no light and
the door was closed, the grinning grandson leaning
against it limply. The picture was a weird, uncanny
one, despite the gay, lightsome appearance of the visitors.
The old woman, in high, shrill tones, had commanded
silence. The men obeyed with a grim scepticism,
while the women seemed really awed by their
surroundings.</p>

<p>The Witch began by reading the fortune of John
Tullis, who had been pushed forward by the wide-eyed
Prince. In a cackling monotone she rambled through a
supposititious history of his past, for the chief part so
unintelligible that even he could not gainsay the statements.
Later, she bent her piercing eyes upon the
Prince and refused to read his future, shrilly asserting
that she had not the courage to tell what might befall
the little ruler, all the while muttering something about
the two little princes who had died in a tower ages and
ages ago. Seeing that the boy was frightened, Tullis
withdrew him to the background. The Countess Marlanx,
who had returned that morning to Edelweiss as
mysteriously as she had left, came next. She was
smiling derisively.</p>

<p>&quot;You have just returned from a visit to some one whom
you hate,&quot; began the Witch. &quot;He is your husband. You
will marry again. There is a fair-haired man in love
with you. You are in love with him. I can see
trouble&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>But the Countess deliberately turned away from the
table, her cheeks flaming with the consciousness that a
smile had swept the circle behind her graceful back.</p>

<p>&quot;Ridiculous,&quot; she said, and avoided John Tullis's gaze.
&quot;I don't care to hear any more. Come, Baron You
are next.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton King, subdued and troubled in his mind,
found himself studying his surroundings and the people
who went so far to make them interesting. He glanced
from time to time at the delicate, eager profile of the
girl beside him; at the soft, warm cheek and the caressing
brown hair; at the little ear and the white slim neck
of her&mdash;and realised just what had happened to him.
He had fallen in love; that was the plain upshot of it.
It had come to pass, just as he had hoped it would in
his dearest dreams. He was face to face with the girl
of royal blood that the story books had created for him
long, long ago, and he was doing just what he had
always intended to do: falling heels over head and hopelessly
in love with her. Never had he seen hair grow
so exquisitely about the temples and neck as this one's
hair&mdash;but, just to confound his budding singleness of
interest, his gaze at that instant wandered off and fell
upon something that caused him to stare hard at a
certain spot far removed from the coiffure of a fair and
dainty lady.</p>

<p>His eye had fallen upon a crack in the door that led
to the kitchen, although he had no means of knowing
that it was a kitchen. To his amazement, a gleaming
eye was looking out upon the room from beyond this
narrow crack. He looked long and found that he was
not mistaken. There was an eye, glued close to the
opposite side of the rickety door, and its gaze was
directed to the Countess Marlanx.</p>

<p>The spirit of adventure, recklessness, bravado&mdash;whatever
you may choose to call it&mdash;flared high in the soul
of this self-despised outsider. He could feel a strange
thrill of exaltation shooting through his veins; he knew
as well as he knew anything that he was destined to
create commotion in that stately crowd, even against
his better judgment. The desire to spring forward and
throw open the door, thus exposing a probable con-
federate, was stronger than he had the power to resist.
Even as he sought vainly to hold himself in check, he
became conscious that the staring eye was meeting his
own in a glare of realisation.</p>

<p>Without pausing to consider the result of his action,
he sprang across the room, shouting as he did so that
there was a man behind the door. Grasping the latch,
he threw the door wide open, the others in the room
looking at him as if he were suddenly crazed.</p>

<p>He had expected to confront the owner of that basilisk
eye. There was not a sign of a human being in sight.
Beyond was a black little room, at the back of which
stood an old cooking stove with a fire going and a
kettle singing. He leaped through, prepared to grasp
the mysterious watcher, but, to his utter amazement, the
kitchen was absolutely empty, save for inanimate things.
His surprise was so genuine that it was not to be mistaken
by the men who leaped to his side. He had time
to note that two of them carried pistols in their hands,
and that Tullis and Quinnox had placed themselves between
the Prince and possible danger.</p>

<p>There was instant commotion, with cries and exclamations
from all. Quick as the others were, the old woman
was at his side before them, snarling with rage. Her
talon-like fingers sunk into his arm, and her gaze went
darting about the room in a most convincing way. Some
minutes passed before the old woman could be quieted.
Then King explained his action. He swore solemnly,
if sheepishly, that he could not have been mistaken,
and yet the owner of that eye had vanished as if swallowed
up by the mountain.</p>

<p>Baron Dangloss was convinced that the young man had
seen the eye. Without compunction he began a search
of the room, the old woman looking on with a grin of
glee.</p>

<p>&quot;Search! Search!&quot; she croaked. &quot;It was the Spirit
Eye! It is looking at you now, my fine baron! It finds
you, yet cannot be found. No, no! Oh, you fools!
Get out! Get out! All of you! Prince or no Prince,
I fear you not, nor all your armies. This is my home!
My castle! Go! Go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was a man here, old woman,&quot; said the Baron
coolly. &quot;Where is he? What is your game? I am
not to be fooled by these damnable tricks of yours.
Where is the man?&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed aloud, a horrid sound. The Prince
clutched Tullis by the leg in terror.</p>

<p>&quot;Brace up, Bobby,&quot; whispered his big friend, leaning
down to comfort him. &quot;Be a man!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&mdash;it's mighty hard,&quot; chattered Bobby, but he
squared his little shoulders.</p>

<p>The ladies of the party had edged forward, peering
into the kitchen, alarm having passed, although the exclamation
&quot;boo!&quot; would have played havoc with their
courage.</p>

<p>&quot;I swear there was some one looking through that
crack,&quot; protested King, wiping his brow in confusion.
&quot;Miss&mdash;er&mdash;I should say&mdash;<i>you</i> could have seen it from
where you stood,&quot; he pleaded, turning to the lady in
grey.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me, I wish I had,&quot; she cried. &quot;I've always wanted
to see some one snooping.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no window, no trap door, no skylight,&quot; remarked
the Baron, puzzled. &quot;Nothing but the stovepipe,
six inches in diameter. A man couldn't crawl out
through that, I'm sure. Mr. King, we've come upon a
real mystery. The eye without a visible body.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure I saw it,&quot; reiterated Truxton. The Prince's
aunt was actually laughing at him. But so was the
Witch, for that matter. He didn't mind the Witch.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old woman stepped into the middle of the
room and began to wave her hands in a mysterious
manner over an empty pot that stood on the floor in
front of the stove. The others drew back, watching
her with the greatest curiosity.</p>

<p>A droning song oozed from the thin lips; the gesticulations
grew in weirdness and fervor. Then, before their
startled eyes, a thin film of smoke began to rise from the
empty pot. It grew in volume until the room was quite
dense with it. Even more quickly than it began, it disappeared,
drawn apparently by some supernatural agency
into the draft of the stove and out through the rickety
chimney pipe. Even Dangloss blinked his eyes, and not
because they were filled with smoke.</p>

<p>A deafening crash, as of many guns, came to their
ears from the outside. With one accord the entire party
rushed to the outer door, a wild laugh from the hag
pursuing them.</p>

<p>&quot;There!&quot; she screamed. &quot;There goes all there was of
him! And so shall we all go some day. Fire and
smoke!&quot;</p>

<p>Not one there but thought on the instant of the Arabian
nights and the genii who went up in smoke&mdash;those
never-to-be-forgotten tales of wonder.</p>

<p>Just outside the door stood Lieutenant Saffo of the
guard, his hand to his cap. He was scarcely distinguishable,
so dark had the day become.</p>

<p>&quot;Good Lord!&quot; shouted Tullis. &quot;What's the matter?
What has happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The storm, sir,&quot; said Saffo. &quot;It is coming down the
valley like the wind.&quot; A great crash of thunder burst
overhead and lightning darted through the black, swirling
skies.</p>

<p>&quot;Very sudden, sir,&quot; added Mr. Hobbs from behind.
&quot;Like a puff of wind, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>The Witch stood in the door behind them, smiling as
amiably as it was possible for her to smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Come in,&quot; she said. &quot;There's room for all of you.
The spirits have gone. Ha, ha! My merry man! Even
the eye is gone. Come in, your Highness. Accept the
best I can offer&mdash;shelter from the hurricane. I've seen
many, but this looks to be the worst. So it came sudden,
eh? Ha, ha!&quot;</p>

<p>The roar of wind and rain in the trees above seemed
like a howl of confirmation. Into the hovel crowded the
dismayed pleasure-seekers, followed by the soldiers, who
had made the horses fast at the first sign of the storm.</p>

<p>Down came the rain in torrents, whisked and driven,
whirled and shot by the howling winds, split by the
lightning and urged to greater glee by the deafening
applause of the thunder. Apple carts in the skies!</p>

<p>Out in the dooryard the merry grandson of the Witch
was dancing as if possessed by revelling devils.</p>

<h3>LOOKING FOR AN EYE</h3>


<p>&quot;Washing the dead men's bones,&quot; was the remark King
made a few minutes later. The storm was at its height;
the sheets of rain that swept down the pebbly glen
elicited the gruesome sentence. He stood directly behind
the quaking Loraine, quite close to the open door;
there is no doubt that the observation was intended for
her ears, maliciously or otherwise.</p>

<p>She gave him an awed glance, but no verbal response.
It was readily to be seen that she was terrified by the
violence of the mountain tornado. As if to shame him
for the frivolous remark, she suddenly changed her position,
putting herself behind him.</p>

<p>&quot;I like that,&quot; he remonstrated, emboldened by the elements.
&quot;You leave me in front to be struck by the first
bolt of lightning that comes along. And I a stranger,
too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it awful?&quot; she murmured, her fingers in her ears,
her eyes tightly closed. &quot;Do you think we'll be struck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not,&quot; he assured her. &quot;This is a charmed
spot. It's a frolic of her particular devils. She waves
her hand: all the goblins and thunder-workers in this
neck of the woods hustle up to see what's the matter.
Then there's an awful rumpus. In a minute or two
she'll wave her hand and&mdash;presto! It will stop raining.
But,&quot; with a distressed look out into the thick of it, &quot;it
would be a beastly joke if lightning should happen to
strike that nag of mine. I'd not only have to walk to
town, but I'd have to pay three prices for the brute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think she's perfectly&mdash;ooh!&mdash;perfectly wonderful.
Goodness, that was a crash! Where do you think it
struck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you'll stand over here a little closer I'll point out
the tree. See? Right down the ravine there? See the
big limb swaying? That's the place. The old lady is
carrying her joke too far. That's pretty close home.
Stand right there, please. I won't let it rain in on you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are very good, Mr. King. I&mdash;I've always
thought I loved a storm. Ooh! But this is too terrible!
Aren't you really afraid you'll be struck? Thanks, ever
so much.&quot; He had squared himself between her and the
door, turning his back upon the storm: but not through
cowardice, as one might suppose.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't mention it. I won't mind it so much, don't
you know, if I get struck in the back. How long ago
did you say it was that you went to school with my
sister?&quot;</p>

<p>All this time the Witch was haranguing her huddled
audience, cursing the soldiers, laughing gleefully in the
faces of her stately, scornful guests, greatly to the
irritation of Baron Dangloss, toward whom she showed
an especial attention.</p>

<p>Tullis was holding the Prince in his arms. Colonel
Quinnox stood before them, keeping the babbling, leering
beldame from thrusting her face close to that of the
terrified boy. Young Vos Engo glowered at Truxton
King from the opposite side of the room. Mr. Hobbs
had safely ensconced himself in the rear of the six
guardsmen, who stood near the door, ready to dash forth
if by any chance the terrified horses should succeed in
breaking away.</p>

<p>The Countess Marlanx, pale and rigid, her wondrous
eyes glowing with excitement, stood behind John Tullis,
straight and strong, like a storm spirit glorying in the
havoc that raged about her. Time and again she leaned
forward to utter words of encouragement in the ear of
the little Prince, never without receiving a look of gratitude
and surprise from his tall protector.</p>

<p>And all this time the goose-herd grandson of the Witch
was dancing his wild, uncanny solo in the thick of the
brew, an exalted grin on his face, strange cries of delight
breaking from his lips: a horrid spectacle that fascinated
the observers.</p>

<p>With incredible swiftness the storm passed. Almost
at its height, there came a cessation of the roaring
tempest; the downpour was checked, the thunder died
away and the lightning trickled off into faint flashes.
The sky cleared as if by magic. The exhibition, if you
please, was over!</p>

<p>Even the most stoical, unimpressionable men in the
party looked at each other in bewilderment and&mdash;awe,
there was no doubt of it. The glare that Dangloss bent
upon the hag proved that he had been rudely shaken
from his habitual complacency.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the most amazing thing I've ever seen,&quot; he said,
over and over again.</p>

<p>The Countess Marlanx was trembling violently. Tullis,
observing this, tried to laugh away her nervousness.</p>

<p>&quot;Mere coincidence, that's all,&quot; he said. &quot;Surely you
are not superstitious. You can't believe she brought
about this storm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't that,&quot; she said in a low voice. &quot;I feel as if
a grave personal danger had just passed me by. Not
danger for the rest of you, but for me alone. That is
the sensation I have: the feeling of one who has stepped
back from the brink of an abyss just in time to avoid
being pushed over. I can't make you understand. See!
I am trembling. I have seen no more than the rest of
you, yet am more terrified, more upset than Robin, poor
child. Perhaps I am foolish. I <i>know</i> that something
dreadful has&mdash;I might say, touched me. Something that
no one else could have seen or felt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nerves, my dear Countess. Shadows! I used to see
them and feel them when I was a lad no bigger than
Bobby if left alone in the dark. It is a grown-up fear
of goblins. You'll be over it as soon as we are outside.&quot;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the cavalcade started down the rain-swept
road toward the city, dry blankets having been
placed across the saddles occupied by the ladies and the
Prince. The Witch stood in her doorway, laughing
gleefully, inviting them to come often.</p>

<p>&quot;Come again, your Highness,&quot; she croaked sarcastically.</p>

<p>&quot;The next time I come, it will be with a torch to burn
you alive!&quot; shouted back Dangloss. To Tullis he added:
&quot;'Gad, sir, they did well to burn witches in your town
of Salem. You cleared the country of them, the pests.&quot;</p>

<p>Darkness was approaching fast among the sombre
hills; the great pass was enveloped in the mists and the
gloaming of early night. In a compact body the
guardsmen rode close about Prince Robin and his friend.
Ingomede had urged this upon Tullis, still oppressed by
the feeling of disaster that had come over her in the
hovel.</p>

<p>&quot;It means something, my friend, it means something,&quot;
she insisted. &quot;I feel it&mdash;I am sure of it.&quot; Riding quite
close beside him, she added in lower tones: &quot;I was with
my husband no longer ago than yesterday. Do you
know that I believe it is Count Marlanx that I feel
everywhere about me now? <i>He</i>&mdash;his presence&mdash;is in the
air! Oh, I wish I could make you feel as I do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't told me why you ran away on Sunday,&quot;
he said, abruptly, dismissing her argument with small
ceremony.</p>

<p>&quot;He sent for me. I&mdash;I had to go.&quot; There was a new,
strange expression in her eyes that puzzled him for a
long time. Suddenly the solution came: she was completely
captive to the will of this hated husband. The
realisation brought a distinct, sickening shock with it.</p>

<p>Down through the lowering shades rode the Prince's
party, swiftly, even gaily by virtue of relaxation from
the strain of a weird half hour. No one revealed the
slightest sign of apprehension arising from the mysterious
demonstration in which nature had taken a hand.</p>

<p>Truxton King was holding forth, with cynical good
humour, for the benefit, if not the edification of Baron
Dangloss, with whom he rode&mdash;Mr. Hobbs galloping behind
not unlike the faithful Sancho of another Quixote's
day.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all tommy-rot, Baron,&quot; said Truxton. &quot;We've
got a dozen stage wizards in New York who can do all
she did and then some. That smoke from the kettle is
a corking good trick&mdash;but that's all it is, take my word
for it. The storm? Why, you know as well as I do,
Baron, that she can't bring rain like that. If she could,
they'd have her over in the United States right now,
saving the crops, with or without water. That was
chance. Hobbs told me this morning it looked like rain.
By the way, I must apologise to him. I said he was
a crazy kill-joy. The thing that puzzles me is what
became of the owner of that eye. I'll stake my life on
it, I saw an eye. 'Gad, it looked right into mine.
Queerest feeling it gave me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that's it, my young friend. What became of the
eye? Poof! And it is gone. We searched immediately.
No sign. It is most extraordinary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll admit it's rather gruesome, but&mdash;I say, do you
know I've a mind to look into that matter if you don't
object, Baron. It's a game of some sort. She's a
wily old dame, but I think if we go about it right we
can catch her napping and expose the whole game. I'm
going back there in a day or two and try to get at the
bottom of it. That confounded eye worries me. She's
laughing up her sleeve at us, too, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should advise you to keep away from her, my friend.
Granted she has tricked us: why not? It is her trade.
She does no harm&mdash;except that she's most offensively
impudent. And I rather imagine she'll resent your
investigation, if you attempt it. I can't say that I'd
blame her.&quot; The Baron laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Baron, it struck me a bit shivery at the time, but I
want to say to you now that the eye that I saw at the
crack was not that of an idle peeper, nor was it a mere
fakir's substitute. It was as malevolent as the devil and
it glared&mdash;do you understand? Glared! It didn't
<i>peep!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton King, for reasons best known to himself, soon
relapsed into a thoughtful, contemplative silence. Between
us, he was sorely vexed and disappointed. When
the gallant start was made from the glen of &quot;dead
men's bones,&quot; he found that he was to be cast utterly
aside, quite completely ignored by the fair Loraine. She
rode off with young Count Vos Engo without so much
as a friendly wave of the hand to him. He said it over
to himself several times: &quot;not even a friendly wave of
her hand.&quot; It was as if she had forgotten his existence,
or&mdash;merciful Powers! What was worse&mdash;as if she took
this way of showing him his place. Of course, that being
her attitude, he glumly found his place&mdash;which
turned out rather ironically to be under the eye of a
police officer&mdash;and made up his mind that he would stay
there.</p>

<p>Vos Engo, being an officer in the Royal Guard, rode
ahead by order of Colonel Quinnox. Truxton, therefore,
had her back in view&mdash;at rather a vexing distance, too&mdash;for
mile after mile of the ride to the city. Not so far
ahead, however, that he could not observe every movement
of her light, graceful figure as she swept down the King's
Highway. She was a perfect horsewoman, firm, jaunty,
free. Somehow he knew, without seeing, that a stray
brown wisp of hair caressed her face with insistent
adoration: he could see her hand go up from time to
time to brush it back&mdash;just as if it were not a happy
place for a wisp of hair. Perhaps&mdash;he shivered with
the thought of it&mdash;perhaps it even caressed her lips.
Ah, who would not be a wisp of brown hair!</p>

<p>He galloped along beside the Baron, a prey to gloomy
considerations. What was the use? He had no chance
to win her. That was for story-books and plays. She
belonged to another world&mdash;far above his. And even
beyond that, she was not likely to be attracted by such
a rude, ungainly, sunburned lout as he, with such chaps
about as Vos Engo, or that what's-his-name fellow, or
a dozen others whom he had seen. Confound it all, she
was meant for a prince, or an archduke. What chance
had he?</p>

<p>But she was the loveliest creature he had ever seen.
Yes; she was the golden girl of his dreams. Within
his grasp, so to speak, and yet he could not hope to seize
her, after all. Was she meant for that popinjay youth
with the petulant eye and the sullen jaw? Was he to
be the lucky man, this Vos Engo?</p>

<p>The Baron's dry, insinuating voice broke in upon the
young man's thoughts. &quot;I think it's pretty well understood
that she's going to marry him.&quot; The little old
minister had been reading King's thoughts; he had the
satisfaction of seeing his victim start guiltily. It was
on the tip of Truxton's tongue to blurt out: &quot;How the
devil did you know what I was thinking about?&quot; But
he managed to control himself, asking instead, with
bland interest:</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed? Is it a good match, Baron?&quot;</p>

<p>The Baron smiled. &quot;I think so. He has been a trifle
wild, but I believe he has settled down. Splendid family.
He is desperately in love, as you may have noted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hadn't thought much about it. Is she in love with
him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She sees a great deal of him,&quot; was the diplomatic
answer.</p>

<p>Truxton considered well for a minute or two, and then
bluntly asked:</p>

<p>&quot;Would you mind telling me just who she is, Baron?
What is her name?&quot;</p>

<p>Dangloss was truly startled. He gave the young man
a quick, penetrating glance; then a set, hard expression
came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean, sir, that you don't know her?&quot; he asked,
almost harshly.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know her name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you had the effrontery to&mdash;My excellent friend,
you amaze me. I can't believe it of you. Why, sir,
how dare you say this to me? I know that Americans
are bold, but, by gad, sir, I've always looked upon them
as gentlemen. You&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on, Baron Dangloss,&quot; interrupted Truxton, very
red in the face. &quot;Don't say it, please. You'd better
hear my side of the story first. She went to school with
my sister. She knows me, but, confound it, sir, she refuses
to tell me who she is. Do you think that is fair?
Now, I'll tell you how it came about.&quot; He related the
story of the goldfish and the pinhook. The Baron
smiled comfortably to himself, a sphinx-like expression
coming into his beady eyes as he stared steadily on
ahead; her trim grey back seemed to encourage his admiring
smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, my boy, if she elects to keep you in the dark
concerning her name, it is not for me to betray her,&quot;
he said at the end of the recital. &quot;Ladies in her position,
I dare say, enjoy these little mysteries. If she
wants you to know, she'll tell you. Perhaps it would be
well for you to be properly, officially presented to her
hi&mdash;to the young lady. Your countryman, Mr. Tullis,
will be glad to do so, I fancy. But let me suggest:
don't permit your ingenuousness to get the better of
you again. She's having sport with you on account
of it. We all know her propensities.&quot;</p>

<p>It was dusk when they entered the northern gates.
Above the Castle, King said good-bye to Tullis and the
Countess, gravely saluted the sleepy Prince, and followed
Mr. Hobbs off to the heart of the city. He was hot
with resentment. Either she had forgotten to say good-bye
to him or had wilfully decided to ignore him altogether;
at any rate, she entered the gates to the Castle
grounds without so much as an indifferent glance in his
direction.</p>

<p>Truxton knew in advance that he was to have a sleepless,
unhappy night.</p>

<p>In his room at the hotel he found the second anonymous
letter, unquestionably from the same source, but this
time printed in crude, stilted letters. It had been stuck
under the door, together with some letters that had been
forwarded from Teheran.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Leave the city at once. You are in great danger.
Save yourself</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>This time he did not laugh. That it was from Olga
Platanova he made no doubt. But why she should
interest herself so persistently in his welfare was quite
beyond him, knowing as he did that in no sense had he
appealed to her susceptibility. And what, after all,
could she mean by &quot;great danger&quot;? &quot;Save yourself!&quot;
He sat for a long time considering the situation. At
last he struck the window sill a resounding thwack with
his fist and announced his decision to the silent, disinterested
wall opposite.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take her advice. I'll get out. Not because I'm
afraid to stay, but because there's no use. She's got
no eyes for me. I'm a plain impossibility so far as she's
concerned. It's Vos Engo&mdash;damn little rat! Old
Dangloss came within an ace of speaking of her as 'her
Highness.' That's enough for me. That means she's
a princess. It's all very nice in novels, but in real life
men don't go about picking up any princess they happen
to like. No, sir! I might just as well get out while I
can. She treated me as if I were a yellow dog to-day&mdash;after
I'd been damned agreeable to her, too, standing
between her and the lightning. I might have been
struck. I wonder if she would have been grateful. No;
she wouldn't. She'd have smiled her sweetest, and said:
&quot;wasn't it lucky?&quot;</p>

<p>He picked up the note once more. &quot;If I were a storybook
hero, I'd stick this thing in my pocket and set out
by myself to unravel the mystery behind it. But I've
chucked the hero job for good and all. I'm going to
hand this over to Dangloss. It's the sensible thing to
do, even if it isn't what a would-be hero in search of a
princess aught to do. What's more, I'll hunt the Baron
up this very hour. Hope it doesn't get Olga into
trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>He indulged in another long spell of thoughtfulness.
&quot;No, by George, I'll not turn tail at the first sign of
danger. I'll stay here and assist Dangloss in unravelling
this matter. And I'll go up to that Witch's
hole before I'm a day older to have it out with her. I'll
find out where the smoke came from and I'll know where
that eye went to.&quot; He sighed without knowing it. &quot;By
Jove, I'd like to do something to show her I'm not the
blooming duffer she thinks I am.&quot;</p>

<p>He could not find Baron Dangloss that night, nor early
the next day. Hobbs, after being stigmatised as the
only British coward in the world, changed his mind and
made ready to accompany King to the hovel in Ganlook
Gap.</p>

<p>By noon the streets in the vicinity of the Plaza were
filled with strange, rough-looking men, undeniably
labourers.</p>

<p>&quot;Who are they?&quot; demanded King, as they rode past a
particularly sullen, forbidding crowd at the corner below
the city hail.</p>

<p>&quot;There's a strike on among the men who are building
the railroad,&quot; said Hobbs. &quot;Ugly looking crowd, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A strike? 'Gad, it's positively homelike.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard a bit ago that the matter has been adjusted.
They go back to work to-morrow, slight increase in
pay and a big decrease in work. They were to have
had their answer to-day. Mr. Tullis, I hear, was instrumental
in having the business settled without a row.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'd better look out for these fellows,&quot; said King,
very soberly. &quot;I don't like the appearance of 'em. They
look like cut-throats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take my word for it, sir, they are. They're the riff-raff
of all Europe. You should have seen them of a
Sunday, sir, before the order went out closing the
drinking places on that day. My word, they took the
town. There was no living here for the decent people.
Women couldn't go out of their houses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope Baron Dangloss knows how to handle them?&quot;
in some anxiety. &quot;By the way, remind me to look up
the Baron just as soon as we get back to town this
evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we ever get back!&quot; muttered the unhappy Mr.
Hobbs. Prophetic lamentation!</p>

<p>In due time they rode into the sombre solitudes of
Ganlook Gap and up to the Witch's glen. Here Mr.
Hobbs balked. He refused to adventure farther than
the mouth of the stony ravine. Truxton approached
the hovel alone, without the slightest trepidation. The
goose-herd grandson was driving a flock of geese across
the green bowl below the cabin. The American called
out to him and a moment later the youth, considerably
excited, drove his geese up to the door. He could understand
no English, nor could Truxton make out what he
was saying in the native tongue. While they were
vainly haranguing each other the old woman appeared
at the edge of the thicket above the hut. Uttering
shrill exclamations, she hurried down to confront King
with blazing eyes. He fell back, momentarily dismayed.
Her horrid grin of derision brought a flush to his cheek;
he faced her quite coolly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll lay you a hundred gavvos that the kettle and
smoke experiment is a fake of the worst sort,&quot; he announced,
after a somewhat lengthy appeal to be allowed
to enter the hut as a simple seeker after knowledge.</p>

<p>&quot;Have it your own way! Have it your own way!&quot; she
cackled.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell you what I'll do; if I can't expose that trick in
ten minutes, I'll make you a present of a hundred gavvos.&quot;</p>

<p>She took him up like a flash, a fact which startled and
disconcerted him not a little. Her very eagerness
augured ill for his proposition. Still, he was in for it;
he was determined to get inside the hut and solve the
mystery, if it were possible. Exposure of the Witch
would at least attract the interest if not the approval
of a certain young lady in purple and fine linen. That
was surely worth while.</p>

<p>With a low, mocking bow, the shrivelled hag stood aside
and motioned for him to precede her into the hovel. He
looked back at Mr. Hobbs. That gentleman's eyes
seemed to be starting from his head.</p>

<p>&quot;A hundred gavvos is a fortune not easily to be won,&quot;
said the old dame. &quot;How can I be sure that you will
pay me if you lose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is in my pocket, madam. If I don't pay, you may
instruct your excellent grandson to crack me over the
head. He looks as though he'd do it for a good deal
less money, I'll say that for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is honest&mdash;as honest as his grandmother,&quot; cried the
old woman. She bestowed a toothless grin upon him.
&quot;Now what is it you want to do?&quot;</p>

<p>They were standing in the centre of the wretched
living-room. The goose-boy was in the door, looking
on with strangely alert, questioning eyes, ever and anon
peering over his shoulder toward the spot where Hobbs
stood with the horses. He seldom took his gaze from the
face of the old woman, a rat-like smile touching the
corners of his fuzz-lined lips.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to go through that kitchen, just to satisfy
myself of one or two things.&quot; King was looking hard
at the crack in the kitchen door. Suddenly he started
as if shot.</p>

<p>The staring, burning eye was again looking straight
at him from the jagged crack in the door!</p>

<p>&quot;I'll get you this time,&quot; he shouted, crossing the room
in two eager leaps. The door responded instantly to
his violent clutch, swung open with a bang, and disclosed
the interior of the queer little kitchen.</p>

<p>The owner of that mocking, phantom eye was gone!</p>

<p>Like a frantic dog, Truxton dashed about the little
kitchen, looking in every corner, every crack for signs
of the thing he chased. At last he paused, baffled,
mystified. The old woman was standing in the middle
of the outer room, grinning at him with what was
meant for complacency, but which struck him at once as
genuine malevolence.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha, ha!&quot; she croaked. &quot;You fool! You fool!
Search! Smell him out! All the good it will do you!
Ha, ha!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By gad, I <i>will</i> get at the bottom of this!&quot; shouted
Truxton, stubborn rage possessing him. &quot;There's some
one here, and I know it. I'm not such a fool as to believe&mdash;Say!
What's that? The ceiling! By the eternal,
that scraping noise explains it! There's where the
secret trap-door is&mdash;in the ceiling! Within arm's
reach, at that! Watch me, old woman! I'll have your
spry friend out of his nest in the shake of a lamb's tail.&quot;</p>

<p>The hag was standing in the kitchen door now, still
grinning evilly. She watched the eager young man
pound upon the low ceiling with a three-legged stool
that he had seized from the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see how he got up there so quickly, though.
He must be like greased lightning.&quot;</p>

<p>He was pounding vigorously on the roughly boarded
ceiling when the sharp voice of the old woman, raised in
command, caused him to lower the stool and turn upon
her with gleaming, triumphant eyes. The look he saw
in her face was sufficient to check his enterprise for the
moment. He dropped the stool and started toward her,
his arms extended to catch her swaying form. The
look of the dying was in her eyes; she seemed to be
crumpling before him.</p>

<p>He reached her in time, his strong arms grasping the
frail, bent figure as it sank to the floor. As he lifted
her bodily from her feet, intent upon carrying her to
the open air, her bony fingers sank into his arm with
the grip of death, and&mdash;could he believe his ears!&mdash;a
low, mocking laugh came from her lips.</p>

<p>Down where the pebbly house-yard merged into the
mossy banks, Mr. Hobbs sat tight, still staring with
gloomy eyes at the dark little hut up the glen. His
sturdy knees were pressing the skirts of the saddle
with a firmness that left no room for doubt as to the
tension his nerves were under. Now and then he murmured
&quot;My word!&quot; but in what connection it is doubtful
if even he could tell. A quarter of an hour had passed
since King disappeared through the doorway: Mr.
Hobbs was getting nervous.</p>

<p>The shiftless, lanky goose-herd came forth in time, and
lazily drove his scattered flock off into the lower glen.</p>

<p>The horses were becoming impatient. To his extreme
discomfort, not to say apprehension, they were constantly
pricking their ears forward and snorting in the
direction of the hovel; a very puzzling circumstance,
thought Mr. Hobbs. At this point he began to say
&quot;dammit,&quot; and with some sense of appreciation, too.</p>

<p>Presently his eye caught sight of a thin stream of
smoke, rather black than blue, arising from the little
chimney at the rear of the cabin. His eyes flew very
wide open; his heart experienced a sudden throbless
moment; his mind leaped backward to the unexplained
smoke mystery of the day before. It was on the end
of his tongue to cry out to his unseen patron, to urge
him to leave the Witch to her deviltry and come along
home, when the old woman herself appeared in the doorway&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>She sat down upon the doorstep, pulling away at a long
pipe, her hooded face almost invisible from the distance
which he resolutely held. He felt that she was eyeing
him with grim interest. For a few minutes he waited,
a sickening doubt growing up in his soul. A single
glance showed him that the chimney was no longer emitting
smoke. It seemed to him that the old woman was
losing all semblance of life. She was no more than a
black, inanimate heap of rags piled against the door-jamb.</p>

<p>Hobbs let out a shout. The horses plunged viciously.
Slowly the bundle of rags took shape. The old woman
arose and hobbled toward him, leaning upon a great
cane.</p>

<p>&quot;Whe&mdash;where's Mr. King?&quot; called out Hobbs.</p>

<p>She stopped above him and he could see her face. Mr.
Hobbs was chilled to the bone. Her arm was raised, a
bony finger pointing to the treetops above her hovel.</p>

<p>&quot;He's gone. Didn't you see him? He went off among
the treetops. You won't see him again.&quot; She waited a
moment, and then went on, in most ingratiating tones:
&quot;Would you care to come into my house? I can show
you the road he took. You&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>But Mr. Hobbs, his hair on end, had dropped the
rein of King's horse and was putting boot to his own
beast, whirling frantically into the path that led away
from the hated, damned spot! Down the road he
crashed, pursued by witches whose persistence put to
shame the efforts of those famed ladies of Tam
O'Shanter in the long ago; if he had looked over his
shoulder, he might have discovered that he was followed
by a riderless horse, nothing more.</p>

<p>But a riderless horse is a gruesome thing&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<h3>STRANGE DISAPPEARANCES</h3>


<p>The further adventures of Mr. Hobbs on this memorable
afternoon are quickly chronicled, notwithstanding
the fact that he lived an age while they were transpiring,
and experienced sensations that would still be fresh in
his memory if he lived to be a hundred.</p>

<p>He was scarcely well out of sight of the cabin when his
conscience began to smite him: after all, his patron
might be in dire need of his services, and here he was,
fleeing from an old woman and a whiff of smoke! Hobbs
was not a physical coward, but it took more than a mile
of hard-ridden conscience to bring his horse to a standstill.
Then, with his heart in his mouth, he slowly began
to retrace his steps, walking where he had galloped a
moment before. A turn in the road brought him in
view of something that caused him to draw rein sharply.
A hundred yards ahead, five or six men were struggling
with a riderless bay horse.</p>

<p>&quot;My Gawd!&quot; ejaculated Hobbs. &quot;It's <i>his</i> horse! I
might have known!&quot;</p>

<p>He looked eagerly for his patron. There was no sign
of him, so Hobbs rode slowly forward, intent upon asking
the woodmen&mdash;for such they appeared to be&mdash;to
accompany him to the glen, now but a short distance
ahead.</p>

<p>As he drew nearer, it struck him forcibly that the men
were not what he had thought them to be. They were
an evil-looking lot, more like the strikers he had seen in
the town earlier in the day. Even as he was turning
the new thought over in his mind, one of them stepped
out of the little knot, and, without a word of warning,
lifted his arm and fired point blank at the little Englishman.
A pistol ball whizzed close by his head. His
horse leaped to the side of the road in terror, almost unseating
him.</p>

<p>But Hobbs had fighting blood in his veins. What is
more to the point, he had a Mauser revolver in his
pocket. He jerked it out, and, despite a second shot
from the picket, prepared to ride down upon the party.
An instant later half a dozen revolvers were blazing
away at him. Hobbs turned at once and rode in the
opposite direction, whirling to fire twice at the unfriendly
group. Soon he was out of range and at
leisure. He saw the futility of any attempt to pass
them. The only thing left for him to do was to ride
as quickly as possible to the city and give the alarm: at
the same time, to acquaint the police with the deliberate
assault of the desperadoes.</p>

<p>His mind was so full of the disaster to Truxton King&mdash;he
did not doubt for an instant that he had been
destroyed by the sorceress&mdash;that he gave little thought
to his own encounter with the rascals in the roadway.
He had come to like the impetuous young man with the
open purse and the open heart. Despite his waywardness
in matters conventional to the last degree he could
not but admire him for the smile he had and the courage
that never failed him, even when the smile met the frown
of rebuke.</p>

<p>Riding swiftly through the narrow, sunless defile he
was nearing the point where the road connected with
the open Highway; from there on the way was easy and
devoid of peril. Suddenly his horse swerved and leaped
furiously out of stride, stumbling, but recovering himself
almost instantaneously. In the same second he heard
the sharp crack of a firearm, far down the unbroken
ravine to his left. A second shot came, this time from
the right and quite close at hand. His horse was staggering,
swaying&mdash;then down he crashed, Hobbs swinging
clear barely in time to escape being pinioned to the
ground. A stream of blood was pouring from the side
of the poor beast. Aghast at this unheard of wantonness,
the little interpreter knew not which way to turn,
but stood there dazed until a third shot brought him to
his senses. The bullet kicked up the dust near his feet.
He scrambled for the heavy underbrush at the roadside
and darted off into the forest, his revolver in his hand,
his heart palpitating like mad. Time and again as he
fled through the dark thickets, he heard the hoarse
shouts of men in the distance. It dawned upon him at
last that there had been an uprising of some kind in the
city&mdash;that there was rioting and murder going on&mdash;that
these men were not ordinary bandits, but desperate
strikers in quest of satisfaction for grievances ignored.</p>

<p>Night came and he dropped to the soft, dank earth,
utterly exhausted and absolutely lost for the time being
in the pathless hills.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the next morning Colonel Quinnox and
a company of soldiers, riding from the city gates toward
the north in response to a call for help from honest
herders who reported attacks and robberies of an alarming
nature, came upon the stiff, foot-sore, thorn-scratched
Mr. Hobbs, not far from the walls of the
town. The Colonel was not long in grasping the substance
of Hobbs's revelations. He rode off at once for
the Witch's hovel, sending Hobbs with a small, instructed
escort to the Castle, where Baron Dangloss was
in consultation with Mr. Tullis and certain ministers.</p>

<p>The city was peaceful enough, much to the surprise of
Hobbs. No disturbance had been reported, said the
guardsmen who rode beside him. Up in the hills there
had been some depredations, but that was all.</p>

<p>&quot;All?&quot; groaned Mr. Hobbs. &quot;All? Hang it all, man,
wot do you call all? You haven't heard 'alf all of it
yet. I tell you, there's been the devil to pay. Wait till
the Colonel comes back from Ganlook Gap. He'll have
news for you; take it from me, he will. That poor chap
'as gone up in smoke, as sure as my name's Hobbs.&quot;</p>

<p>They met Baron Dangloss near the barracks, across the
park from the Castle. He was in close, earnest conversation
with John Tullis and Count Halfont, both of whom
seemed to be labouring under intense excitement. Over
by the arsenal the little Prince, attended by his Aunt
Loraine and Count Vos Engo&mdash;with two mechanical
guardsmen in the background&mdash;was deep in conversation
with Julius Spantz, the master-of-arms. If he had
been near enough to hear, he might have learned that
Prince Robin's air-gun was very much out of order and
needed attention at once.</p>

<p>The arrival of Hobbs, a pitiful but heroic object, at
once arrested the attention of every one. His story was
heard by a most distinguished audience; in fact, Hobbs
was near to exploding with his own suddenly acquired importance.
Not only were there dark, serious looks from
the men in the party, and distressed exclamations from
the most beautiful young lady in the world (he had
always said that of her), but he had the extreme unction
of bringing tears to the eyes of a prince, and of
hearing manfully suppressed sobs from the throat of the
same august personage.</p>

<p>The looks that went round at the conclusion of his
disjointed and oft-interrupted story, expressed something
more than consternation.</p>

<p>&quot;There is nothing supernatural about King's disappearance,&quot;
said Tullis sharply. &quot;That's all nonsense.
He had money about him and it perhaps turns out that
there really was a man at the crack in the door&mdash;a
clever brigand who to-day has got the better of our
vain-glorious friend. The shooting in the hills is more
disturbing than this, to my mind. Gentlemen, you
shouldn't lose any time in running these fellows down.
It will mean trouble if it gets under way. They're an
ugly lot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This mystery coming on top of the other is all the
more difficult to understand. I mean the disappearance
of the Countess Marlanx,&quot; said Baron Dangloss, pulling
at his imperial in plain perplexity. &quot;But we must not
stop here talking. Will you come with me, Mr. Tullis,
to the Tower? I shall send out my best man to work on
the case of the lady. It is a most amazing thing. I
still have hope that she will appear in person to explain
the affair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think not,&quot; said Tullis gloomily. &quot;This looks like
abduction-foul play, or whatever you choose to call it.
She has never left her father's house in just this manner
before. I believe, Baron, that Marlanx has taken her
away by force. She told me yesterday that she would
never go back to him if she could help it. I have already
given you my suspicions regarding his designs
upon the&mdash;ahem!&quot; Catching the eager gaze of the
Prince, he changed the word &quot;throne&quot; to &quot;treasury.&quot;
The Baron nodded thoughtfully. &quot;The Countess attended
the f&ecirc;te at Baron Pultz's last night, leaving at
twelve o'clock. I said good-night to her at the fountain
and watched her until she passed through the gate
between the Baron's grounds and those of her father adjoining.
She would not permit me to accompany her
to the doors. Her maid had preceded her and was waiting
just beyond the gate&mdash;at least, so she says to-day.
It is less than two hundred feet from the gate to Perse's
doorsteps. Well, she never crossed that space. Her
maid waited for an hour near the fernery and then came
to the Baron's. The Countess has not been seen since
she passed through the gate in the wall. I say that she
has been carried away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The maid will be at my office at eleven with the Duke
of Perse and the house servants. I have detailed a man
to look up this fellow Brutus you speak of, and to ascertain
his whereabouts last night. Come, we will go
to the Tower. The Duke is greatly distressed. He
suspects foul play, I am confident, but he will not admit
that Marlanx is responsible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what about Mr. King?&quot; piped up a small voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel Quinnox has gone to look for him, Bobby,&quot;
began Tullis, frowning slightly. He was interested in
but one human being at that moment.</p>

<p>&quot;I want the old Witch beheaded,&quot; said the Prince.
&quot;Why don't you go, Uncle Jack? He's an American.
He'd help you, I bet, if you were in danger.&quot;</p>

<p>Tullis flushed. Then he patted Prince Robin's shoulder
and said, with no little emotion in his voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I deserve the rebuke, Bobby, but you must
not forget that there is a lady in distress. Which would
you have me do&mdash;desert the lady whom we all love or
the man whom we scarcely know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The lady,&quot; said Bobby promptly. &quot;Hasn't she got a
husband to look after her? Mr. King has no friends,
no relations, nothing. Aunt Loraine likes him and so
do I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a fine chap,&quot; asserted Hobbs, and afterward
marvelled at his own temerity.</p>

<p>Loraine, her merry eyes now dark with anxiety, her
cheeks white with resolution, turned upon John Tullis.
&quot;You might leave the rescue of the Countess to the
proper authorities&mdash;the police,&quot; she said calmly. &quot;I
think it is your duty as an American to head the search
for Mr. King. If Count Marlanx has spirited his wife
away, pray, who has a better right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we are not sure that he&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are sure that Mr. King is either dead or in dire
need of help,&quot; she interrupted hotly. He looked at her
in surprise, swayed by two impulses.</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel Quinnox is quite competent to conduct the
search,&quot; he said shortly.</p>

<p>&quot;But Colonel Quinnox has gone forth on another mission.
He may be unable to give any of his time to the
search for Mr. King. It is outrageous, John Tullis, to
refuse help&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't refuse help,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;They may take
the whole army out to look for him, so far as I am concerned.
But, I'll tell you this&mdash;I consider it my duty
as a man to devote what strength I have to the service of
a <i>woman</i> in trouble. That ends it! Come, Baron; we
will go to the Tower.&quot;</p>

<p>The amazed young woman looked at him with wide,
comprehending eyes. Her lip trembled under the rebuke.
Count Halfont intervened, hastily proposing that a
second party be sent out at once with instructions to
raze the Witch's hut if necessary.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be happy to lead the expedition,&quot; said young
Count Vos Engo, bowing deeply to the young lady herself.</p>

<p>&quot;You shall, Vos Engo,&quot; said Halfont. &quot;Prepare at
once. Take ten men. I shall report to General Braze
for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Tullis turned suddenly to the resentful girl. &quot;Loraine,&quot;
he said gently, as the others drew away, &quot;don't be hard
with me. You don't understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; she said stubbornly. &quot;You are in love
with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; that's quite true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A married woman!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't help it. I must do all I can for her.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked into his honest eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; she murmured, hanging her head.
&quot;What is Mr. King to us, after all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is simply paying for his foolhardiness. Americans
do that the world over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful that you do not pay for something worse
than foolhardiness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you may trust me.&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled brightly up into his face. &quot;Have your
way, then. Remember that I am her friend, too.&quot; Then
she hurried off after the Prince and Vos Engo, who was
already giving instructions to an attentive orderly.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor Mr. King!&quot; she said to the Prince, as they stood
by watching the preparations. &quot;I am afraid, Bobby,
he can't come to your circus this week. I sent the invitation
this morning, early. He may never receive it.
Isn't it dreadful, Count Vos Engo?&quot;</p>

<p>Count Vos Engo was politely concerned, but it should
not be expected that, in his present state of mind regarding
her, he could be seriously grieved by anything
that might have happened to the rash American.</p>

<p>The guard about the Prince was doubled: orders requiring
the strictest care of his person were issued by
Count Halfont. By this time, it may be suspected, the
suspicions of John Tullis had been communicated to men
high in the government; no small amount of credence
was attached to them. Baron Dangloss began to see
things in a different light; things that had puzzled him
before now seemed clear. His office was the busiest place
in Edelweiss.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not unreasonable to suspect that Marlanx, or
some of his agents, having concluded that the Countess
knew too much of their operations, and might not be a
safe repository, decided to remove her before it was too
late. Understand, gentlemen, I don't believe the Countess
is in sympathy with her husband's schemes&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>The Duke of Perse interrupted the doughty baron.
&quot;You assume a great deal, Baron, in saying that he has
schemes inimical to the best interests of this country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I fancy that your Grace will admit that your venerable
son-in-law&mdash;who, if I mistake not, is some ten years
your senior&mdash;has no great love for the reigning power
in Graustark. We will pass that, however,&quot; said the
Baron, pointedly. &quot;We should be wise enough to guard
against any move he may make; it is imperative that we
should not be caught napping.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe he has taken my daughter away by
force. Why should he do so? She goes to him voluntarily
at the end of each visit. There is no coercion.&quot;
He met John Tullis's stony gaze without flinching. &quot;I
insist that she has been stolen by these brigands in the
hills, to be held for ransom.&quot;</p>

<p>The stories of the maid, the footmen, the groundmen
were all to the effect that the Countess had not returned
to her father's home after leaving the f&ecirc;te next door.
There were no signs of a struggle in the garden, nor
had there been the slightest noise to attract the attention
of the waiting maid. It was not impossible, after all,
that she had slipped away of her own accord, possessed
of a sudden whim or impulse.</p>

<p>The new man-servant, suspected by the Countess herself,
passed through the examination creditably. Tullis,
of course, had not yet told Dangloss of the Countess's
own suspicions concerning this man. They were a part of
their joint secret. The American felt sure, however,
that this man knew more of the night's work than he
had told. He conveyed this belief to Dangloss, and a
close watch was set upon the fellow. More than once
during the long afternoon John Tullis found himself
wishing that he had that dare-devil, thoroughbred young
countryman of his, Truxton King, beside him; something
told him that the young man would prove a
treasure in resourcefulness and activity.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, a telegram was brought to Tullis
which upset all of their calculations and caused the
minister of police to swear softly in pure disgust. It
was from the Countess Marlanx herself, sent from
Porvrak, a station far down the railway, in the direction
of Vienna. It was self-explanatory: &quot;I am going to
Schloss Marlanx, there to end my days. There is no
hope for me. I go voluntarily. Will you not understand
why I am leaving Edelweiss? You must know.&quot; It was
signed &quot;Ingomede.&quot;</p>

<p>Tullis was dumbfounded. He caught the penetrating
glance of Dangloss and flushed under the sudden knowledge
that this shrewd old man also understood why she
was leaving Edelweiss. Because of <i>him!</i> Because she
loved him and would not be near him. His heart swelled
exultantly in the next moment; a brave resolve was born
within him.</p>

<p>&quot;We don't need a key to that, my boy,&quot; said the Baron
indulgently. &quot;But I will say that she has damned little
consideration for you when she steals away in the dead
of night, without a word. In a ball dress, too. Unfeeling,
I'd say. Well, we can devote our attention to
Mr. King, who <i>is</i> lost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See here, Baron,&quot; said Tullis after a moment, &quot;I want
you to give me a couple of good men for a few days.
I'm going to Schloss Marlanx. I'll get her away from
that place if I have to kill Marlanx and swing for it.&quot;</p>

<p>At seven o'clock that night, accompanied by two clever
secret service men, Tullis boarded the train for the
West. A man who stood in the tobacconist's shop on
the station platform smiled quietly to himself as the
train pulled out. Then he walked briskly away. It was
Peter Brutus, the lawyer.</p>

<p>A most alluring trap had been set for John Tullis!</p>

<p>The party that had gone to Ganlook Gap in charge of
Count Vos Engo returned at nightfall, no wiser than
when it left the barracks at noon. Riding bravely, but
somewhat dejectedly beside the handsome young officer
in command was a girl in grey. It was her presence with
the troop that had created comment at the gates earlier
in the day. No one could understand why she was riding
forth upon what looked to be a dangerous mission. Least
of all, Count Vos Engo, who had striven vainly to dissuade
her from the purpose to accompany the soldiers.</p>

<p>Now she was coming home with them, silent, subdued,
dispirited&mdash;even more so than she allowed the Count to
see.</p>

<p>&quot;I was hateful to him yesterday,&quot; she said penitently,
as they rode into the city. Vos Engo had been thinking
of something else: the remark disturbed him.</p>

<p>&quot;He was very presumptuous-yesterday,&quot; he said
crossly.</p>

<p>She transfixed him with a look meant to be reproachful.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I managed the ticket for Bobby's circus,&quot;
she said, looking ahead with a genuinely mournful droop
of her lip. &quot;I was sorry for him. Oh, dear, oh, dear
What will his poor mother say&mdash;and his sister?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've done all we can, Loraine. Except to cable,&quot;
he added sourly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I suppose so. Poor fellow!&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Quinnox and his men had been scouring the
hills for bandits. They arrived at the Witch's cabin a
few minutes after Vos Engo and his company. Disregarding
the curses of the old woman, a thorough
search of the place was made. The forest, the ravine,
the mountainside for a mile or more in all directions were
gone over by the searchers. There was absolutely no
sign of the missing man, nor was there the least indication
that there had been foul play.</p>

<p>The old woman's story, reflected by the grandson, was
convincing so far as it went. She said that the young
man remained behind in the kitchen to puzzle himself
over the smoke mystery, while she went out to her doorstep.
The man with the horses became frightened when
she went down to explain the situation to him. He fled.
A few minutes later the gentleman emerged, to find his
horse gone, himself deserted. Cursing, he struck off
down the glen in pursuit of his friend, and that was the
last she saw of him. Not long afterward she heard shooting
in the Gap and sent her grandson to see if anything
could have happened to her late visitor, who, it seems,
owed her one hundred gavvos as a forfeit of some sort.</p>

<b>&quot;Bobby! Don't be foolish. How could I be in love
with <i>him</i>?&quot;</b><br />
<br />
</div>

<p>The further prosecution of the search was left to
Colonel Quinnox and his men. Loraine, shuddering, but
resolute, had witnessed the ransacking of the hut, had
urged the arrest of the hag, and had come away disheartened
but satisfied that the woman had told them
the truth. Quinnox's theory was accepted by all. He
believed that King had fallen into the hands of brigands
and that a heavy ransom would be demanded for his
release.</p>

<p>In a warm-tinted room at the Castle, later on in the
evening, the Prince, in pajamas, was discoursing
bravely on the idiosyncrasies of Fate. His only auditor
was the mournful Loraine, who sat beside the royal
bed in which he wriggled vaguely. The attendants were
far down the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind, Aunt Loraine, you can't help it. I'm
just as sorry as you are. Say, are you in love with
him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In love with whom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. King.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not, silly. What an absurd question. I do
not know him at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's all right, Aunt Loraine. I believe in love at
first sight. He is a&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bobby! Don't be foolish. How could I be in love
with <i>him</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you can't help it sometimes. Even princes fall
in love without knowing it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; dreamily.</p>

<p>&quot;It's mighty hard to make up your mind which one
you love best, though. Dr. Barrett's daughter in New
York is awful nice, but I think she's&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is twenty years older than you, Bobby, if you
mean to say you are in love with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, but I'll grow up, auntie. Anyhow, Paula
Vedrowski is not so old as I. She is&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For heaven's sake, Bobby, do go to sleep!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you care to hear about <i>my</i> love affairs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are perfectly ridiculous!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right for you, auntie. I shan't listen when you
want to tell me about yours. Gee, Uncle Jack listens,
you bet. I wish he was here this minute. Say, is he
ever going to get married?&quot; There was no answer.
He peered over the top of the pillow. There were tears
in his Aunt Loraine's eyes. &quot;Oh, say, auntie, darling,
don't cry! I'll&mdash;I'll go to sleep, honest!&quot;</p>

<p>She was not in love with Truxton King, but she was
a fine, tender-hearted girl, who suffered because of the
thing that had happened to him and because she loved
his sister.</p>

<p>Over in the Hotel Regengetz, on a little table in the
centre of the room, lay a thick envelope with the royal
arms emblazoned in the upper corner. It contained an
invitation to the private circus that had been arranged
for the little Prince, and it bore the name of Truxton
King.</p>

<p>Across the foot of the bed hung his evening clothes,
laid out by a faithful and well-tipped house valet, snug
and ready for instant use.</p>

<p>But where was Truxton King?</p>

<h3>THE IRON COUNT</h3>


<p>When King, in the kindness of his heart, grasped the
old woman to keep her from falling to the floor, he
played directly into the hands of very material agencies
under her control. There was nothing ghostly or even
spiritual in the incidents that followed close upon the
simulated fainting spell of the fortune-teller. It has been
said before that her bony fingers closed upon his arms in
a far from feeble manner. He had no time for surprise
at this sudden recovery; there was only time to see a
fiendish grin flash into her face. The next instant something
struck him in the face; then with a fierce jerk this
same object tightened about his neck. His attempt to
yell out was checked before a sound could issue from his
lips.</p>

<p>It all came to him in a flash. A noose had been dropped
over his head; as he was pulled backward, his startled,
bulging eyes swept the ceiling. The mystery was explained,
but in a manner that left him small room for
satisfaction. Above him a square opening had appeared
in the ceiling; two ugly, bearded faces were leaning over
the edge and strong hands were grasping a thick rope.
In a frenzy of fear and desperation he cast the old
woman from him and tore violently at the rope.</p>

<p>They were drawing hard from above; his toes were
barely touching the floor; he was strangling. Frantically
he grasped the rope, lifting himself from the
floor in the effort to loosen the noose with his free hand.
A hoarse laugh broke upon his dinning ears, the leering
faces drew nearer; and then, as everything went black,
a heavy, yet merciful blow fell upon his head. As consciousness
left him, he felt himself rushing dizzily upward,
grasped by powerful hands and whisked through
the opening into air so hot and stiffling that his last
thought was of the fires of Hell.</p>

<p>Not many minutes passed before consciousness, which
had been but partially lost, returned to him. The ringing
sensation remained in his head, but he was no longer
choking. The noose had been removed from his neck;
the rope itself was now serving as a bond for his hands
and feet, a fact that impressed itself upon him when he
tried to rise. For some time he lay perfectly still,
urging his senses into play: wondering where he was and
what had happened to him.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark and the air was hot and close. Not
a sound came to his throbbing cars. With characteristic
irrepressibility he began to swear softly, but articulately.
Proof that his profanity was mild&mdash;one might
say genteel&mdash;came in an instant. A gruff voice, startlingly
near at hand, interrupted him.</p>

<p>&quot;Spit it out, young feller! Swear like a man, not like
a damn canary bird.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton tried hard to pierce the darkness, a strange
thrill passing through his veins. The hidden speaker
was unquestionably an American.</p>

<p>&quot;What the devil does all this mean?&quot; demanded the
captive. &quot;Where am I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It means business, and you're here, that's where you
are,&quot; was the sarcastic answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you an American?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I'm a Chinaman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come off! Answer square.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I was born in Newport.&quot; As an afterthought:
&quot;Kentucky.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're in a damned nice business, I'll say that for
you,&quot; growled Truxton. &quot;Who is responsible for this
outrage?&quot;</p>

<p>He heard the man yawn prodigiously. &quot;Depends on
what you call an outrage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the damnedest high-handed outrage I've
ever&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better save your breath, young feller. You won't
have it very long, so save what you can of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton was silent for a moment, analysing this unique
remark. &quot;You mean I am to stop breathing altogether?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't know? Well, who does?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll find out when the boss gets good and ready.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a fine American!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, young feller, I've been polite to you, so
don't get gay. I'll come over there and kick your jaw
in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come ahead. Anything to break the monotony.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you get enough of the hangman's knot and
the sandbag? Want more, eh? Well, if I wasn't so
darned comfortable I'd come over there and give it to
you. Now don't rile me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I deserve to be kicked for being such a blithering fool
as to get into this mess. Come on and kick me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You wanted to get a poke at the old man's eye, did
ye? By thunder, that's like an American. Never satisfied
to let things alone. See what it got you into?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The old man's eye? What old man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's for you to find out, if you can. You've made
a hell of a poor start at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a good-natured scoundrel&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks for them kind words.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what are you going to do with me? I don't
like the air in here. It's awful. How long do I stay
here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say, you're a gritty little man. I like your nerve.
Too bad we ain't on the same side. I'll tell you this:
you won't be here long. How would the old girl down
there put it? You're going on a long voyage. That's
it. But first we'll get out of this rat hole, just as soon
as them other guys come back from the cave. You'll
get fresh air purty soon. Now, don't talk any more.
I'm through gossipin'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How do you, an American, happen to be mixed up in
a deal like this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's healthier work than makin' barrels at&mdash;I was goin'
to say Sing Sing, but I hear they've changed the name.
I prefer outdoor work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fugitive, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might call it that. I'm wanted in seven States.
The demand for me is great.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton saw that he could get nothing out of the
satirical rascal, so fell to speculating for himself. That
he was still in the loft above the hovel was more or less
clear to him. His mind, now active, ran back to the
final scene in the kitchen. The trap-door in the ceiling,
evidently a sliding arrangement, explained the mysterious
disappearance of the owner of the eye; he had been
whisked up through the aperture by confederates and
the trap-door closed before it could be discovered. The
smoking kettle no longer puzzled him, now that he
knew of the secret room above the kitchen; a skilfully
concealed blow-pipe could have produced the phenomenon.
The space in which he was now lying, half suffocated,
was doubtless a part of the cleverly designed
excavation at the back of the hovel, the lower half being
the kitchen, the upper an actual gateway to the open
air somewhere in the mountainside.</p>

<p>That he had fallen into the hands of a band of conspirators
was also quite clear to him. Whether they
were brigands or more important operators against the
Crown, he was, of course, in no position to decide. Time
would tell.</p>

<p>It was enough that they expected to kill him, sooner
or later. This, in itself, was sufficient to convince him
that he was not to be held for ransom, but to be disposed
of for reasons best known to his captors.</p>

<p>Like a shot the warning of Olga Platanova flashed into
his brain. Here, then, was the proof that she actually
knew of the peril he was in. But why should he be an
object of concern to these men, whoever they were? His
guard had mentioned &quot;the old man.&quot; Good heavens,
could he mean Spantz? The cold perspiration was
standing on King's brow. Spantz! He recalled the
wickedness in the armourer's face. But why should
Spantz wish him evil? Again intuition, encouraged by
memory, supplied him with a possible, even plausible explanation.</p>

<p>The Anarchists! The Reds! Olga was an avowed
Anarchist; she was almost a prisoner in the house of her
uncle. Truxton's guard sat up suddenly and felt for
his weapon when the captive let out a bitter oath of
understanding and rage.</p>

<p>&quot;By gad, they think I am a detective!&quot; he added, light
coming to him with a rush.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; snapped the other. Truxton could
almost feel the other's body grow tense despite the space
between them. &quot;Are you a detective? Are you? By
God, if you are, I'll finish you up right here.
You&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! They're on the wrong scent. By Jove, the
laugh's on old man Spantz.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oho! So you <i>do</i> know what's up, then? Spantz, eh?
Well, what you've guessed at or found out won't make
much difference, my fine young fellow. They've got
you, and you'll be worse off than Danny Deever in the
mornin'! Hello! Here they come. Now we'll get out
of this infernal bake-oven. Say, do you know, you've
been cuddlin' up against a j'int of warm stove pipe for
nearly an hour? Sh!&quot;</p>

<p>The glimmer of a light came bobbing up from somewhere
behind Truxton; he could see the flickering
shadows on the wall. Two men crept into the room a
moment later. One of them carried a lantern; the other
turned King's body over with his foot.</p>

<p>&quot;You damned brute,&quot; grated the captive.</p>

<p>&quot;Call him what you like, young feller,&quot; said his first
acquaintance. &quot;He can't understand a word you say.
Well, do we pull out?&quot; This to the man with the lantern.</p>

<p>The roof was so low that they were compelled to stoop
in moving about. Truxton saw that the three ruffians
were great, brutal-faced fellows, with bared arms that
denoted toil as well as spoils.</p>

<p>&quot;Immediate!&quot; said the lantern bearer. &quot;Come; we drag
him to the cave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Drag? Nix; we c'n carry him, pard. I'm not for
draggin' him down that passage. Grab hold there,&mdash;you!
Hey, get his feet, damn you!&quot; The third man
was reluctant to understand, but at last grasped the
prisoner by the feet, swearing in a language of his own.
The Yankee desperado took his shoulders, and together,
with earnest grunts, they followed the man with the
lantern, Truxton knew not whither except that it was
away from the wretched sweat-hole.</p>

<p>He could see that they were crowding through a low,
narrow passage, the earthen sides of which reeked with
moisture. Twice they paused to rest, resuming the
journey after a season of cursing, finally depositing
him with scant courtesy upon the rocky floor of what
proved to be a rather commodious cave. The breath was
almost jarred from his body. He had the satisfaction
of driving his two heels viciously against the person of
the man who had held them the last ten minutes, receiving
a savage kick in return.</p>

<p>Daylight streamed into this convenient &quot;hole in the
wall;&quot; lying upon his side, Truxton faced the opening
that looked out upon the world. He saw nothing but
blue sky. Near the opening, looking down as if into
the valley below, stood the tall, gaunt figure of a man,
thin-shouldered and stooped. His back was to the captive,
but King observed that the three men, with two
companions, who sat at the back of the cave, never removed
their gaze from the striking figure outlined
against the sky.</p>

<p>Many minutes passed before the watcher turned
slowly to take in the altered conditions behind him.
King saw that he was old; grey-haired and cadaverous,
with sharp, hawk-like features. This, then, was the &quot;old
man,&quot; and he was not William Spantz. Unlike Spantz
in every particular was this man who eyed him so darkly,
so coldly. Here was a highborn man, a man whose very
manners bespoke for him years at court, a life spent in
the upper world, not among the common people. Truxton
found himself returning the stare with an interest
that brought results.</p>

<p>&quot;Your name is King, I believe,&quot; came from the thin
lips of the old man. The tones were as metallic as the
click of steel.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. May I inquire&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you may not inquire. Put a gag in his mouth.
I don't care to hear anything from him. Gag him and
cut the rope from his feet. He may walk from now on.&quot;</p>

<p>Three men sprang to do his bidding.</p>

<p>King felt in that instant that he was looking for the
first time upon the features of the Iron Count, Marlanx
the dishonoured. He lay there helpless, speechless for
many minutes, glancing at this cruel tyrant. Into his
soul sank the conviction that no mercy would come from
this man, this hater of all men; justice would play no
part in the final, sickening tragedy. It was enough that
Marlanx suspected him of being in the way; to be suspected
was to be condemned. The whole, hellish conspiracy
flashed through his brain. He closed his eyes
with the horror of it all.</p>

<p>Here was Marlanx on Graustark soil, conniving with
cutthroats, commanding them without opposition. What
could it mean except a swift-growing menace to the
Crown&mdash;to the little Prince.</p>

<p>Marlanx was speaking. Truxton looked up, as at an
executioner. The lean, cruel face of that beautiful girl's
husband was not far from his own; the fiery eyes were
burning into his. The Iron Count sat upon a boulder
near his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;So you are the Quixote who would tilt at invisible
windmills, eh? I remember you quite well. We have
met before. Perhaps you remember meeting my eye in
Dame Babba's cabin&mdash;twice, I think. You remember,
I see. Ha, ha! You were very slow not to have caught
such an old man. You were near to it the first time,
but&mdash;you missed it, eh? I thought you might have seen
my heels as I disappeared. I dare say you are wondering
what I intend to do with you, now that I have you.
Well, I am not the man to mince words. Mr. King, you
are quite young, but the good die young. I am very old,
you observe. I will not say that you are to die to-night
or to-morrow or any day, for I do not know. I am going
to send you to a court. Not an ordinary court, Mr.
King, but one of extreme perspicacity. I fancy you will
die before long. We can spare you. I do not approve
of meddlers. It seems to be quite settled that you are a
police agent. Be that as it may, I imagine our little
court of last resort will take no chances, one way or the
other. A man or two, more or less, will not be counted
a year from now.&quot;</p>

<p>The steady, cruel eyes fascinated King. He knew that
he was in desperate straits, that he had one chance in a
million to escape, and yet he found himself held by the
spell of those eyes, drinking in certain metallic monotones
as if hypnotised.</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad you called again at my temporary abode,
Mr. King. Americans are always welcome: the sooner
they come, the sooner it's over. It may interest you to
know that I am very partial to Americans. Were I a
cannibal, I could eat them with relish. If I had my way,
all Americans should be in heaven. The earth surely is
not good enough nor big enough for them, and hell is
already overcrowded. Yes,&quot; reflectively pressing his
nose with a bony forefinger, &quot;I love the Americans dearly.
I should enjoy a similar visit from Mr. John Tullis. Although,
I may say, he seems to be choosing another way
of testing my hospitality. I expect him to visit me in
my humble castle before many days. I should like to
have him remain there until his dying day.&quot; There was
a deep significance in his smile. King shuddered. His
gaze followed the gaunt, spidery old man as he returned
to the opening for another long survey of the valley
below. Night was falling; the sky was growing darker,
and the wind was rising. Marlanx's sharp features were
not so distinguishable when he returned to the boulder.
The men in the cave had not spoken except in whispers.
They appeared to be living in abject fear of this grim
old nobleman.</p>

<p>&quot;Night is coming. I must say farewell, my bold young
friend. My way lies to the north. This is merely a land
of promise to me. You go southward, to the city of
Edelweiss. But not through the gates; oh, no! There
are other ways, as you will find. If you should, by any
chance, escape the jurisdiction of the court I am sending
you to, I sincerely trust you may honour me with another
visit here. I come often to the hovel in the glen.
It is the only friendly house I know of in all Graustark.
Some day I may be able to recompense its beauteous
mistress. My good friends, Dangloss, and Halfont, and
Braze&mdash;and Tullis, whom I know only by reputation&mdash;are,
as yet, unaware of my glorious return to Graustark,
else they would honour me with their distinguished presence.
Some day I may invite them to dine with me. I
shall enjoy seeing them eat of the humble pie I can put
before them. Good-bye, my brave Sir Galahad; I may
never see you again.&quot;</p>

<p>With a courtly bow he turned from the tense-muscled
captive and directed his final instructions to the men.
&quot;Take him at once to the city, but be on your guard. A
single false move now means utter ruin for all of us. Our
affairs go so well at present that we cannot afford to
offend Dame Fortune. She smiles on us, my men. Take
this fool to the house on the Monastery road. There you
will turn him over to the others. It is for them to drag
the truth from his lips. I'd suggest, dear Mr. King,
that you tell them all you know before they begin the
dragging process. It is a very unpleasant way they
have.&quot; With a curt nod to the men, he strode out
through the mouth of the cave and was gone. Dusk had
settled down upon mountain and valley; a thin fog swam
high in the air above. One of the men cut the rope that
bound Truxton's feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Get up,&quot; said the Newport man. &quot;We've got to be
movin'. How'd you like the old man? Smart bug,
ain't he? Say, he'll throw the hooks into them guys
down in Edelweiss so hard one of these days that they
won't come out till they rot out.&quot;</p>

<p>Still gagged and somewhat dizzy, King was hurried off
into the narrow mountain path, closely surrounded by
the five men.</p>

<p>&quot;They tell me your friend, the Cook guy, got plugged
down in the Gap when he tried to duck this afternoon,&quot;
volunteered the Yankee unconcernedly.</p>

<p>Hobbs shot? King's eyes suddenly filled with tears, a
great wave of pity and shame rushing to his heart.
Poor Hobbs! He had led him into this; to gratify a vain-glorious
whim, he had done the little Englishman to death.</p>

<p>The silent, cautious march down the valley, through the
Gap and along the ridge carried them far into the night.
King knew that they were skirting the main roads,
keeping to the almost hidden trails of the mountaineers.
They carried no light, nor did they speak to each other,
except in hoarse whispers. In single file they made their
way, the prisoner between them, weary, footsore and
now desperate in the full realisation of his position.
Being gagged, he could make no appeal to the one man
who might befriend him&mdash;his villainous countryman. It
occurred to him&mdash;grim thought&mdash;that the astute
Marlanx had considered that very probability, and had
made it impossible for him to resort to the cupidity of
the hireling.</p>

<p>At last, when he could scarcely drag his feet after him,
they came to a halt. A consultation followed, but he
could not understand a word. This much he knew: they
were in the hills directly above the northern gates. Two
of the men went forward, moving with extreme caution.
In half an hour they returned and the march was resumed.</p>

<p>Their next halt came sooner than he expected. The
vague, black shadow of a lightless house loomed up before
them. In a twinkling he was hustled across the
road and into a door. Then down a flight of stairs,
through pitchy darkness, guided by two of the men, a
whispered word of advice now and then from the Yankee
saving him from perilous stumbles. He was jerked up
sharply with a command to stand still. A light flashed
suddenly in his face, blinding him for the moment.
Voices in eager, quick conversation came to his ears long
before his eyes could take in the situation.</p>

<p>Soon he saw that they were in a broad, bare cellar;
three men in heavy black beards were in earnest conversation
with several of his captors; all were gesticulating
fiercely.</p>

<p>His Newport companion enlightened him, between puffs
of the pipe he was struggling with. &quot;Here's where we
say good-bye, young fellow. We turn you over to these
gents, whoever they are. I'm sort of out of it when
they get to jabberin' among themselves. I can understand
'em when they talk slow, but, say, did you ever
hear a flock of Union Square sparrows chirp faster than
them fellers is talkin' now? Nix. You go into the
village gay with these Schwabs by the sewer line, I
guess.&quot; Truxton pricked up his ears. &quot;The old man
has had a hole chopped in the sewer here, they tell me,
and it's a snap to get into the city. Not very clean or
neat, but it gets you there. Well, so long! They're
ready, I see. They don't monkey long when they've got
a thing to do. I'd advise you not to be too stubborn
when they get you to headquarters; it may go easier with
you. I'm not so damned bad, young feller. It's just
the business I'm in&mdash;and the company.&quot;</p>

<p>King felt a thrill of real regard for the rascal. He
nodded his thanks and tried to smile. The fellow
grinned and slapped him on the shoulder, unobserved by
the others. In another moment his guardianship was
transferred; he was being hurried across the cellar
toward an open doorway. Down a few stone steps he
was led by the bearded crew, and then pushed through
a hole in what appeared to be a heavy brick wall. He
realised at once where he was. The gurgle of running
water, the odor of foul airs came up to him. It was the
great sewer that ran from the hills through the heart
of the city, flushed continuously by a diverted mountain
stream that swept down from above.</p>

<p>He was wading in cold water over a slippery bottom,
tightly held by two men, the third going ahead with the
lantern. Always ahead loomed the black, opaque circle
which never came nearer, never grew smaller. It was the
ever receding wall of darkness.</p>

<p>He did not know how long they traversed the chill
sewer in this fashion. In time, however, the water got
deeper; rats began to scurry along the sides of the
circle or to swim frantically on in front of the disturbers.
The smells were sickening, overpowering. Only excitement,
curiosity, youth&mdash;whatever you may care to
term it-kept him up and going. The everlasting glory
of youth never ends until old age has provided the surfeit
of knowledge; the strife to see ahead, to find out what is
to be, to know,&mdash;that is youth. Youth dies when curiosity
ends. The emotion is even stronger than the dread
of what may lie beyond in the pallid sea of uncertainty.</p>

<p>His bones were chilled and creaking with fatigue. He
was remorselessly hungry. There was water, but he
could not drink it.</p>

<p>At last the strange journey ended. They came to a
niche in the slimy wall. Up into this the men climbed,
dragging him after them. The man above was cautiously
tapping on what appeared to be solid masonry.
To King's surprise a section of the wall suddenly
opened before them. He was seized from above by
strong hands and literally jerked through the hole, his
companions following. Up narrow steps, through a
sour-smelling passage and&mdash;then, into a long, dimly
lighted room, in the centre of which stood a long table.</p>

<p>He was not permitted to linger here for long, but
passed on into a small room adjoining. Some one,
speaking in English, told him to sit down. The gag was
removed from his stiff, inflamed mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Fetch him some water,&quot; said a voice that he was sure
he recognised&mdash;a high, querulous voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Spantz,&quot; articulated Truxton, turning to the
black-bearded, bent figure.</p>

<p>There was an instance of silence. Then Spantz spoke,
with a soft laugh: &quot;You will not know so much to-morrow,
Herr King. Give him the water, man. He
has much to say to us, and he cannot talk with a dry
throat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor an empty stomach,&quot; added King. He drank long
of the pitcher that was held to his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not the Regengetz,&quot; growled a surly voice.</p>

<p>&quot;You mean, I don't eat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at midnight, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to be an all-night joint.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough,&quot; cried Spantz. &quot;Bring him out here. The
others have come.&quot;</p>

<p>King was pushed out into the larger room, where he
was confronted by a crowd of bewhiskered men and
snaky-eyed women with most intellectual nose-glasses.
It required but a glance to convince him that the
whiskers were false.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour he was probed with questions concerning
his business in Edelweiss. Threats followed
close upon his unsatisfactory answers, though they were
absolutely truthful. There was no attempt made to disguise
the fact that they were conspiring against the
government; in fact, they were rather more open than
secretive. When he thought of it afterward, a chill
crept over him. They would not have spoken so openly
before him if they entertained the slightest fear that he
would ever be in a position to expose them.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll find a way to make you talk to-morrow, my
friend. Starving is not pleasant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You would not starve me!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p>&quot;No. You will have the pleasure of starving yourself,&quot;
said a thin-eyed fellow whom he afterward knew as Peter
Brutus.</p>

<p>He was thrown back into the little room. To his surprise
and gratification, the bonds on his wrists were removed.
Afterward he was to know that there was
method in this action of his gaolers: his own utter impotency
was to be made more galling to him by the maddening
knowledge that he possessed hands and feet and
lungs&mdash;and could not use them!</p>

<p>He found a match in his box and struck it. There was
no article of furniture. The floor was bare, the walls
green with age. He had a feeling that there would be
rats; perhaps lizards. A search revealed the fact that
his purse, his watch and his pocket-knife were missing.
Another precious match showed him that there were no
windows. A chimney hole in the ceiling was, perhaps,
the only means by which fresh air could reach this dreary
place.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess I'm here to stay,&quot; he said to himself.
He sat down with his back to the wall, despair in his
soul. A pitiful, weak smile came to him in the darkness,
as he thought of the result of his endeavour to &quot;show
off&quot; for the benefit of the heartless girl in rajah silk.
&quot;What an ass I am,&quot; he groaned. &quot;Now she will never
know.&quot;</p>

<p>Sleep was claiming his senses. He made a pillow of his
coat, commended himself to the charity of rats and
other horrors, and stretched his weary bones upon the
relentless floor.</p>

<p>&quot;No one will ever know,&quot; he murmured, his last waking
thought being of a dear one at home.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE GROUND</h3>


<p>Day and night were the same to the occupant of the
little room. They passed with equal slowness and impartial
darkness. Five days that he could account for
crawled by before anything unusual happened to break
the strain of his solitary, inexplicable confinement. He
could tell when it was morning by the visit of a bewhiskered
chambermaid with a deep bass voice, who carried
a lighted candle and kicked him into wakefulness.
The second day after his incarceration began, he was
given food and drink. It was high time, for he was
almost famished. Thereafter, twice a day, he was led
into the larger room and given a surprisingly hearty
meal. Moreover, he was allowed to bathe his face and
hands and indulge in half an hour's futile stretching
of limbs. After the second day few questions were
asked by the men who had originally set themselves up
as inquisitors. At first they had treated him with a
harshness that promised something worse, but an incident
occurred on the evening of the second day that
changed the whole course of their intentions.</p>

<p>Peter Brutus had just voiced the pleasure of the
majority by urging the necessity for physical torture to
wring the government's secrets from the prisoner. King,
half famished, half crazed by thirst, had been listening
to the fierce argument through the thin door that separated
the rooms. He heard the sudden, eager movement
toward the door of his cell, and squared himself against
the opposite wall, ready to fight to the death. Then
there came a voice that he recognised.</p>

<p>A woman was addressing the rabid conspirators in tones
of deadly earnestness. His heart gave a bound. It was
the first time since his incarceration that he had heard
the voice of Olga Platanova, she who had warned him,
she who still must be his friend. Once more he threw
himself to the floor and glued his ear to the crack; her
voice had not the strident qualities of the other women
in this lovely company.</p>

<p>&quot;You are not to do this thing,&quot; she was saying. King
knew that she stood between her companions and the
door. &quot;You are not to touch him! Do you hear me,
Peter Brutus? All of you?&quot;</p>

<p>There followed the silence of stupefaction, broken at
last by a voice which he recognised as that of old man
Spantz.</p>

<p>&quot;Olga! Stand aside!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! You shall not torture him. I have said he is no
spy. I still say it. He knows nothing of the police and
their plans. He has not been spying upon us. I am
sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can you be sure of it?&quot; cried a woman's voice,
harsh and strident.</p>

<p>&quot;He has played with you,&quot; sneered another.</p>

<p>&quot;I will not discuss the point. I know he is not what
you say he is. You have no right to torture him. You
have no right to hold him prisoner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God, girl, we cannot turn him loose now. He must
never go free again. He must die.&quot; This was from
Spantz.</p>

<p>&quot;We cannot release him, I grant you,&quot; she said, and
Truxton's heart sank. &quot;Not now, but afterward, yes.
When it is all over he can do no harm. But, hear me
now, all of you. If he is harmed in any way, if he is
maltreated, or if you pursue this design to starve him,
I shall not perform my part of the work on the 26th.
This is final.&quot;</p>

<p>For a full minute, it seemed to King, no one spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot withdraw,&quot; exclaimed Peter Brutus. &quot;You
are pledged. You are sworn. It is ordained.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Try me, and see if I will not do as I say. He is to
be treated kindly so long as we hold him here and he is
to be released when the committee is in power. Then
he may tell all that he knows, for it will be of no avail.
He cannot escape, that you know. If he were a spy I
would offer no objection to your methods. He is an
American gentleman, a traveller. I, Olga Platanova,
say this to you. It is not a plea, not a petition; it is
an ultimatum. Spare him, or the glorious cause must
suffer by my defection.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sh! Not so loud, girl! He can hear every word you
say!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should it matter, madam? He is where he can
do no harm to our cause. Let him hear. Let him understand
what it is that we are doing. Are we ashamed of
our duty to the world? If so, then we are criminals, not
deliverers. I am not ashamed of what God wills me to
do. It is horrible, but it is the edict of God. I will
obey. But God does not command us to torture an innocent
man who happens to fall into our hands. No!
Let him hear. Let him know that I, Olga Platanova,
am to hurl the thing that is to destroy the life of Prince
Robin. I am not afraid to have him know to-day what
the world will know next week. Let him hear and revile
me now, as the world will do after it is over and I am
gone. The glory will be mine when all the people of this
great globe are joined to our glorious realm. Then the
world will say that Olga Platanova was not a beast, but
a deliverer, a creator! Let him hear!&quot;</p>

<p>The listener's blood was running cold. The life of
Prince Robin! An assassination! &quot;The thing that will
destroy!&quot; A bomb! God!</p>

<p>For half an hour they argued with her, seeking to turn
her from the stand she had taken; protesting to the last
stage, cursing her for a sentimental fool. Then they
came to terms with her. Truxton King owed his life to
this strange girl who knew him not at all, but who believed
in him. He suffered intensely in the discovery
that she was, in the end, to lend herself to the commission
of the most heartless and diabolical of crimes&mdash;the
destruction of that innocent, well-worshipped boy of
Graustark.</p>

<p>&quot;You must be in love with this simple-minded American,
who comes&mdash;&quot; Peter Brutus started to say at one
stage of the discussion, when the frail girl was battling
almost physically with her tormentors.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop! Peter Brutus, you shall not say that! You
know where my love lies! Don't say that to me again,
you beast!&quot; she had cried, and Brutus was silenced.</p>

<p>Truxton was brought into the room a few minutes later.
He was white with emotion as he faced the Committee of
Ten. Before a word could be addressed to him he
blurted out:</p>

<p>&quot;You damned cowards! Weak as I am, I would have
fought for you, Miss Platanova, if I could have got
through that door. Thank you for what you have done
to convince these dogs! I would to God I could save
you from this thing you are pledged to do. It is frightful!
I cannot think it of you! Give it up! All of
you, give this thing up! I will promise secrecy&mdash;I will
never betray what I have heard. Only don't do this awful
thing! Think of that dear little boy&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Olga Platanova cried out and covered her eyes with
her hands, murmuring the words &quot;dear little boy&quot; over
and over again. She was led from the room by William
Spantz. Peter Brutus stood over King, whose arms
were held by two stalwart men.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; he commanded. &quot;We spare you, not for
her sake, but for the sake of the cause we serve. Hear
me: you are to be held here a prisoner until our plans are
consummated. You will be properly fed and cared for.
You have heard Miss Platanova say that she will cook
the food for you herself, but you are not to see her. Do
not seek to turn her from her purpose. That you cannot
do. She is pledged to it; it is irrevocable. We have
perhaps made a mistake in bringing you here: it would
have been far wiser to kill you in the beginning,
but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>King interrupted him. &quot;I haven't the least doubt that
you will kill me in the end. She may not be here to
protect me after&mdash;after the assassination.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is prepared to die by the same bomb that slays
the Prince,&quot; was all that Brutus would say in response
to this, but King observed the sly look that went round
amongst them. He knew then that they meant to kill
him in the end.</p>

<p>Afterward, in his little room, he writhed in the agony
of helplessness. The Prince, his court, the government&mdash;all
were to be blasted to satisfy the end of this sickening
conspiracy. Loraine! She, too, was doomed! He
groaned aloud in his misery and awe.</p>

<p>Food and water came after that, but he ate and drank
little, so depressed had he become. He sought for every
means of escape that suggested itself to him. The walls,
the floors, the doors, the stairway to the armourer's
shop&mdash;all were impassable, so carefully was he guarded.
From time to time he heard inklings of the plot which
was to culminate on the fatal 26th; he did not get the
details in particular, but he knew that the bomb was to
be hurled at the Prince near the entrance to the plaza
and that Marlanx's men were to sweep over the stricken
city almost before the echo died away.</p>

<p>There was a telegraph instrument in the outer room.
He could hear it ticking off its messages day and night,
and could hear the discussion of reports as they came
in or went out. It soon became clear to him that the
wire connected the room with Marlanx's headquarters
near Balak in Axphain, a branch instrument being stationed
in the cave above the Witch's hut. He marvelled
at the completeness of the great conspiracy; and
marvelled more because it seemed to be absolutely unknown
to the omnipresent Dangloss.</p>

<p>On his third night he heard the Committee discussing
the failure of one of Marlanx's most cunning schemes.
The news had come in over the wire and it created no
small amount of chagrin among the Red conspirators.
That one detail in their mighty plot should go contrary
to expectations seemed to disturb them immeasurably.
King was just beginning to realise the stupendous possibilities
of the plot; he listened for every detail with a
mind so fascinated by horror that it seemed hardly able
to grasp the seriousness of his own position.</p>

<p>It seemed that Marlanx deemed it necessary&mdash;even imperative&mdash;to
the welfare of the movement, that John
Tullis should be disposed of summarily before the crucial
chapter in their operations. Truxton heard the
Committee discussing the fiasco that attended his first attempt
to draw the brainy, influential American out of
the arena. It was clear that Marlanx suspected Tullis
of a deep admiration for his wife, the Countess Ingomede;
he was prepared to play upon that admiration
for the success of his efforts. The Countess disappeared
on a recent night, leaving the court in extreme doubt as
to her fate. Later a decoy telegram was sent by a
Marlanx agent, informing Tullis that she had gone to
Schloss Marlanx, never to return, but so shrewdly
worded that he would believe that it had been sent by
coercion, and that she was actually a prisoner in the
hands of her own husband. Tullis was expected to follow
her to the Castle, bent on rescue. As a matter of
fact, the Countess was a prisoner in the hills near Balak,
spirited away from her own garden by audacious agents
of the Iron Count. Tullis was swift to fall into the
trap, but, to the confusion of the arch-plotter, he was
just as swift to avoid the consequences.</p>

<p>He left Edelweiss with two secret service men, bound
for Schloss Marlanx. All unknown to him, a selected
company of cutthroats were in waiting for him on the
hills near the castle. To the amazement of the conspirators,
he suddenly retraced his tracks and came back to
Edelweiss inside of twenty-four hours, a telegram stopping
him at Gushna, a hundred miles down the line. The
message was from Dangloss and it was in cipher. A
trainman in the service of Marlanx could only say, in
explanation, that the American had smiled as he deciphered
the dispatch and at once left the carriage with
his men to await the up-train at six o'clock.</p>

<p>Peter Brutus repeated a message he had just received
from Marlanx at Balak. It was to the effect that he had
reason to believe that his wife had managed, through
an unknown traitor, to send word to the Tower that she
was not at Schloss Marlanx, nor in any immediate
danger. He felt himself supported in this belief by the
obvious fact that no further efforts had been made by
Tullis or the police since that day. The authorities apparently
were inactive and Tullis was serenely secure
at the Royal Castle. The guard about the Prince, however,
had been largely increased.</p>

<p>Tullis was known to be re-organising the Royal Guard,
supported by the ministry to a man, it was said; not
even the Duke of Perse opposed him.</p>

<p>&quot;The Count is more afraid of this man Tullis than of
all the rest,&quot; averred Peter Brutus. &quot;He has reasons
to hate and fear the Americans. That is why he desires
the death of our prisoner. He has said, time and again,
over the wire that King will in some way escape and play
the deuce with our plans. It does not seem possible,
however. We have him absolutely secure, and Olga&mdash;well,
you know how she feels about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see why he should be so disturbed by Tullis,&quot;
growled one of the men. &quot;He has no real authority at
court and he is but one man against an unseen army that
will not strike until everything is ready. There can be
no&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is what I have said to my master, Julius, but
he will not be convinced. He says that he has had experience
with one American, Lorry, and he knows the
breed. Tullis has more power at court than the people
think. He is shrewd and strong and not to be caught
napping. As a matter of fact, the Count says, Tullis
has already scented danger in the air and has induced
the ministry to prepare for an uprising. Of course, he
cannot know of the dynamiting that is to open the way
to success, but it is true that if anybody can upset our
plans, it is this meddling American. He is a self-appointed
guardian of the Prince and he is not to be
sneered at. The regents are puppets, nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p>Julius Spantz agreed with Brutus. &quot;I know that the
guard is being strengthened and that certain precautions
are being taken to prevent the abduction of the
Prince. It is common rumour among the soldiers that
Count Marlanx will some day seek to overthrow the
government and take the throne. The air is full of
talk concerning this far-distant possibility. Thank God,
it is to be sooner than they think. If Tullis and General
Braze were given a month or two longer, I doubt if we
could succeed. The blow must catch them unprepared.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the 22d, Saturday is the 26th. They can
do nothing in four days,&quot; said one of the women.</p>

<p>&quot;Count Marlanx will be ready on the 26th. He has
said so. A new strike will be declared on the railroad
on the 25th and the strikers will be in the city with their
grievances. Saturday's celebration will bring men from
the mountains and the mines to town. A single blow,
and we have won.&quot; So spoke Brutus.</p>

<p>&quot;Then why all this fear of Tullis?&quot; demanded Anna
Cromer.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not like the Iron Count,&quot; added Madame Drovnask
with a sneer.</p>

<p>Olga Platanova had not spoken. She was not there to
talk. She was only to act on the 26th of July. She
was the means to an end.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, fear or no fear, the Count lies awake trying
to think of a way to entice him from the city before the
26th. It may be silly, madam, but Count Marlanx is
a wiser man than any of us here. He is not afraid of
Dangloss or Braze or Quinnox, but he is afraid of what
he calls 'American luck!' He is even superstitious
about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We must not&mdash;we cannot fail,&quot; grated William
Spantz, and the cry was reiterated by half a dozen
voices.</p>

<p>&quot;The world demands success of us!&quot; cried Anna
Cromer. &quot;We die for success, we die for failure! It is
all one!&quot;</p>

<p>The next morning, after a sleepless night, Truxton
King made his first determined attempt to escape. All
night long he had lain there thinking of the horrid
thing that was to happen on the black 26th. He counted
the days, the hours, the minutes. Morning brought the
23d. Only three days more! Oh, if he could but get
one word to John Tullis, the man Marlanx feared; if
he could only break away from these fiends long enough
to utter one cry of warning to the world, even with his
dying gasp!</p>

<p>Marlanx feared the Americans! He even feared him,
a helpless captive! The thrill of exultation that ran
through his veins was but the genesis of an impulse that
mastered him later on.</p>

<p>He knew that two armed men stood guard in the outer
room day and night. The door to the stairway leading
into the armourer's shop was of iron and heavily barred;
the door opening into the sewer was even more securely
bolted; besides, there was a great stone door at the foot
of the passage. The keys to these two doors were never
out of the possession of William Spantz; one of his
guards held the key to the stairway door. His only
chance lay in his ability to suddenly overpower two men
and make off by way of the armourer's shop.</p>

<p>When his little door was opened on the morning of the
23d, Truxton King's long, powerful figure shot
through as if sped by a catapult. The man with the
candle and the knife went down like a beef, floored by a
blow on the jaw.</p>

<p>The American, his eyes blazing with hope and
desperation, kept onward&mdash;to find himself face to face
with Olga Platanova!</p>

<p>She was staring at him with frightened eyes, her lips
apart, her hands to her breast. The tableau was brief.
He could not strike her down. With a curse he was
turning to the man on the floor, eager to snatch the
keys from his belt. A scream from her drawn lips held
him; he whirled and looked into the now haggard face
of the girl he had considered beautiful. The penalty
for her crime was already written there. She was to die
in three days!</p>

<p>&quot;He has not the key!&quot; she cried. &quot;Nor have I. You
have no chance to escape. Go back! Go back! They
are coming!&quot;</p>

<p>A key rattled in the door. When it swung open, two
men stood in the aperture, both with drawn pistols. The
girl leaped between them and the helpless, defeated
American.</p>

<p>&quot;Remember!&quot; she cried. &quot;You are not to kill him!&quot;</p>

<p>Peter Brutus had risen from the floor, half dazed but
furious. He made a vicious leap at King, his knife ready
for the lunge.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad it's you,&quot; roared King, leaping aside. His
fist shot out and again Brutus went down. The men in
the doorway actually laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;A good blow, even if it avails you nothing,&quot; said one
of them drily. &quot;He is not an especial favorite with us.
Return to your room at once. Miss Platanova, call your
uncle. It is now necessary to bind the fellow's hands.
They are too dangerous to be allowed to roam at large
in this fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>All day long Truxton paced his little prison, bitterly
lamenting his ill-timed effort. Now he would be even
more carefully guarded. His hands were bound behind
his back; he was powerless. If he had only waited!
Luck had been against him. How was he to know that
the guard with the keys had gone upstairs when Olga
brought his breakfast down? It was fate.</p>

<p>The 23d dragged itself into the past and the 24th
was following in the gloomy wake of its predecessors.
Two days more! He began to feel the approach of
madness! His own death was not far away. It would
follow that of the Prince and of Olga Platanova, his
friend. But he was not thinking of his own death; he
was thinking of the Prince's life!</p>

<p>The atmosphere of suppressed excitement that characterised
the hushed gatherings in the outer room did not
fail to leave its impression upon him; he knew there was
murder in the hearts of these fanatics; he could feel the
strain that held their hitherto vehement lips to tense
whisperings and mutterings. He could distinguish the
difference between the footsteps of to-day and those of
yesterday; the tread was growing lighter, unconsciously
more stealthy with each passing hour.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours! That was all!</p>

<p>Truxton found himself crying bitterly from time to
time; not because he was in terror but because he knew
of the thing that hourly drew nearer despite the fact
that he knew!</p>

<p>Olga Platanova's voice was heard no more before the
Committee of Ten. Something told him that she was
being groomed and primed in an upstairs room! Primed
like a gun of war! He wondered if she could be praying
for courage to do the thing that had been set down for
her to do. Food now came irregularly to him. She was
no longer preparing it.</p>

<p>She was making herself ready!</p>

<p>Early that night, as he lay with his ear to the crack of
the door, he heard them discussing his own death. It
was to come as soon as Olga had gone to her reward!
She was not there to defend him. Spantz had said that
she was praying in her room, committing her soul to
God! Truxton King suddenly pricked up his ears, attracted
by a sentence that fell from the lips of one of the
men.</p>

<p>&quot;Tullis is on his way to the hills of Dawsbergen by
this time. He will be out of the way on the 26th safe
enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Count Marlanx was not to be satisfied until he had
found the means to draw him away from Edelweiss,&quot;
said another. &quot;This time it will work like a charm. Late
this afternoon Tullis was making ready to lead a troop
of cavalry into the hills to effect a rescue. Sancta
Maria! That was a clever stroke! Not only does he
go himself, but with him goes a captain with one hundred
soldiers from the fort. Ha, ha! Marlanx is a
fox! A very exceptional fox!&quot;</p>

<p>Tullis off to the hills? With soldiers, to effect a
rescue! Truxton sat up, his brain whirling.</p>

<p>&quot;A wise fox!&quot; agreed Peter Brutus, thickly. His lips
were terribly swollen from King's final blow. &quot;Tullis
goes off chasing a jack-o'-lantern in the hills; Marlanx
sits by and laughs at the joke he's played. It is good!
Almost too good to be true. I wonder what our fine
prisoner will say to it when the new prisoner comes to
keep him company over the 26th.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII" />CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A NEW PRISONER ARRIVES</h3>


<p>It was far past midnight when King was roused from
the doze into which he had fallen, exhausted and disconsolate,
an hour earlier. Sounds of unusual commotion
reached him from the outer room. Instantly he was
wide awake, breathing heavily in the sudden overpowering
fear that he had slept for many hours and that the
time had come for the conspirators to go forth. Was
it the 26th?</p>

<p>Loud, quick commands came to his ears; the moving
of eager footsteps; the drawing of bolts.</p>

<p>&quot;They are here at last,&quot; he heard some one say. &quot;God,
this suspense has been horrible. But they are here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stand ready, then, with the guns!&quot; cried Peter
Brutus. &quot;It may be a trick, after all. Don't open that
door down there, Spantz, until you know who is on the
outside.&quot;</p>

<p>Then followed a long interval of dead silence.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right,&quot; came at last in the relieved, eager
voice of Peter Brutus. &quot;Clear the way, comrades. Give
them room! By our Holy Father, this is a brave triumph.
Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>Heavy footsteps clogged into the room, accompanied
by stertorous breathing and no small amount of grunting
from masculine throats. Doors were closed, bolts
shot, and then many voices let loose their flow of eager
exclamations. Not one, but three or four languages
were spoken by the excited, intense occupants of the
outer room; King could, make nothing of what they
said. Finally the sharp, incisive voice of William
Spantz broke through the babble, commanding silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Still unconscious,&quot; he said, when some measure of
order was secured.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; grunted one of the men, evidently a newcomer.
&quot;Since we left the house above the ramparts. No need
for gags or bonds, but we used them, just the same.
Now that we are here, what is to be done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We will have our instructions to-morrow. The Count
is to inform us before nightfall where she is to be removed
to. Next week she is to go to Schloss Marlanx.&quot;
Brutus inserted a cruel, heartless laugh, and then added:
&quot;There she is to remain until he is quite ready to take her
to new apartments&mdash;in town. Trust the master to dispose
of her properly. He knows how to handle women
by this time.&quot;</p>

<p>A woman, thought Truxton. The Countess! They
had brought her here from Balak, after all. What a
remorseless brute Marlanx must be to maltreat his beautiful
wife as&mdash;Truxton did not complete the angry reflection.
Words from the other side of the door checked
the train of thought.</p>

<p>&quot;To my mind, she is more beautiful than his own wife,&quot;
observed Anna Cromer. &quot;She will be a fine morsel for
the Count, who has even cast longing eyes on so homely
a mortal as I.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All women are alike to him,&quot; said Spantz sententiously.
&quot;I hope she is not to be left here for long. I
don't like women about at a time like this. No offence,
Madame Drovnask.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She'll go to-morrow night, I'm sure,&quot; said Peter. &quot;I
told the Count we could not keep her here over the&mdash;over
the 26th. You see, there is a bare possibility that
none of us may ever come back after the bomb is hurled.
See? We don't want a woman to die of starvation down
here, in that event. I don't care what happens to the
man in there. But the Count does not want this one to
starve. Oh, no; not he.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We must put her in the room with the American for
the present. You are sure he will take her away before
Saturday? A woman's cries are most distressing.&quot; It
was Spantz who spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll stop her crying,&quot; volunteered Anna Cromer
harshly.</p>

<p>&quot;I fancy you could, my dear,&quot; agreed Spantz. They
all laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;She's regaining her senses,&quot; exclaimed one of the
men. &quot;Stand back, every one. Give her air.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Air?&quot; cried Anna Cromer. &quot;It's at a premium down
here, Raoul.&quot;</p>

<p>Presently the door to King's room was thrown open.
He had got to his feet and was standing in the centre of
the room, his eyes blinking in the glare of light.</p>

<p>&quot;Holloh!&quot; cried Peter Brutus, &quot;you up, eh? We've
got a fair lady for you, my friend. Get back there,
you dog! Keep in your corner.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton faced the ugly crowd beyond the door for a
moment and then fell back to the corner to watch the
proceedings with wondering, pitying eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a fine bunch of human beings,&quot; he blurted
out, savage with despair and rage. No one gave heed
to the compliment.</p>

<p>A man with a lighted candle entered first, holding the
light above his head. He was followed by two others,
who supported the drooping, tottering figure of a
woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Let her sit there against the wall, Drago. Julius,
fetch in more candles. She must not be left in the dark.
<i>He</i> says she is not to be frightened to death. Women
are afraid of the dark&mdash;and strange dogs. Let there
be light,&quot; scoffed Peter Brutus, spitting toward King.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll get you for that some day,&quot; grated the American,
white with anger. Peter hesitated, then spat again and
laughed loudly.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; commanded William Spantz. &quot;We are
not children.&quot; Turning to King he went on, a touch of
kindness in his voice: &quot;Cheer her if you can. She is
one of your class. Do not let the lights go out.&quot;</p>

<p>Raising his hands, he fairly drove the others from the
doorway. An instant later, King and his miserable,
half-conscious companion were alone, locked in together,
the fitful light from the candle on the floor playing hide
and seek in shadows he had not seen before during his
age of imprisonment.</p>

<p>For a long time he stood in his corner, watching the
figure huddled against the opposite wall. Her face was
not plainly visible, her head having dropped forward
until the chin nestled in the lace jabot at her throat. A
mass of tangled hair fell across her eyes; her arms hung
limply at her sides; small, modish riding hoots showed
beneath the hem of her skin, forlorn in their irresoluteness.
Her garments were sadly bedraggled; a pathetic
breast rose and fell in choking sobs and gasps.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started forward, his eyes wide and staring.
He had seen that grey riding habit before! He had seen
the hair!</p>

<p>Two eager steps he took and then halted, half way. She
had heard him and was raising her eyes, bewildered and
wavering between dreamland and reality.</p>

<p>&quot;Great Jehovah!&quot; he gasped, unbelieving. &quot;You? My
God, is it you?&quot;</p>

<p>He dropped to his knees before her, peering into her
startled eyes. A look of abject terror crossed the tired,
tear-stained face. She shrank away from him, shivering,
whimpering like a cowed child.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it? Where am I?&quot; she moaned. &quot;Oh, let me
go! What have I done, that you should bring me here?
Let me go, Mr. King! You are not so wicked as&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I? I bring you here?&quot; he interrupted, aghast. Then
he understood. Utter dismay filled his eyes. &quot;You
think that I have done this thing to you? God above
us! Look! I, too, am a prisoner here. I've been here
for days, weeks, years. They are going to kill me after
to-morrow. And you think that I have done this to
you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what&mdash;Oh, Mr. King, what does it all
mean? Forgive me! I see now. You are bound&mdash;you
are suffering&mdash;you are years older. I see now. But
why is it? What have you done? What have I done?&quot;</p>

<p>She was growing hysterical with terror.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't shrink from me,&quot; he urged. &quot;Try to calm yourself.
Try to look upon me as a friend&mdash;as a possible
saviour. Lie quiet, do, for a little while. Think it all
out for yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>He knelt there before her while she sobbed out the last
agony of alarm. There were no tears in her eyes; racking
sobs shook her slender body; every nerve was aquiver,
he could see. Patiently he waited, never taking his firm,
encouraging gaze from her face. She grew calmer,
more rational. Then, with the utmost gentleness, he
persuaded her to rise and walk about the little room with
him.</p>

<p>&quot;It will give you strength and courage,&quot; he urged.
&quot;Poor little girl! Poor little girl!&quot;</p>

<p>She looked up into his face, a new light coming into
her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't talk now,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Take your time.
Hold to my arm, please. There! In a little while you'll
be able to tell me all about it&mdash;and then we'll set about
to find a way to escape these devils. We'll laugh at
'em, after all.&quot;</p>

<p>For five or ten minutes he led her back and forth across
the room, very tenderly. At first she was faint and uncertain;
then, as her strength and wits came back to her,
courage took the place of despair. She smiled wanly and
asked him to sit down with her.</p>

<p>&quot;A way to escape, you said,&quot; she murmured, as he
dropped to her side. &quot;Where are we? What is it all
about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not so loud,&quot; he cautioned. &quot;I'll be perfectly candid
with you. You'll have to be very, very brave. But wait.
Perhaps it will be easier for you to tell me what has
happened to you, so far as you know. I can throw light
on the whole situation, I think. Tell me, please, in your
own way and time. We're in a sorry mess, and it looks
black, but, this much I can tell you: you are to be set
free in a few days, unharmed. You may rest easy.
That much is assured.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you?&quot; she whispered, clutching his arm tightly,
the swift thrill of relief dying almost as it was born.
&quot;What of you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'll get out all right,&quot; he affirmed with a confidence
he did not feel. &quot;I'm going to get you out of
this or die in the attempt. Sh! Don't oppose me,&quot; he
went on whimsically. &quot;I've always wanted to be a hero,
and here's my chance. Now tell me what happened to
you.&quot;</p>

<p>Her piquant, ever-sprightly face had lost the arrogance
that had troubled all his dreams of conquest. She
was pale and shivering and so sorely distressed that he
had it in his heart to clasp her in his arms as one might
do in trying to soothe a frightened child. Her face
grew cloudy with the effort to concentrate her thoughts;
a piteous frown settled upon her brow.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not sure that I can recall everything. It is all
so terrible&mdash;so unaccountable. It's like a dream that
you try to remember and cannot. Finding you here
in this place is really the strangest part of it. I cannot
believe that I am awake.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked long and anxiously into his face, her eyebrows
drawn together in an earnest squint of uncertainty.
&quot;Oh, Mr. King, I have had such a dreadful&mdash;dreadful
time. Am I awake?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's what I've been asking of myself,&quot; he murmured.
&quot;I guess we're both awake all right. Nightmares
don't last forever.&quot;</p>

<p>Her story came haltingly; he was obliged to supply
many of the details by conjecture, she was so hazy and
vague in her memory.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the narrative, however, Truxton
was raised to unusual heights; he felt such a thrill of
exaltation that for the moment he forgot his and her
immediate peril. In a perfectly matter-of-fact manner
she was informing him that her search for him had not
been abandoned until Baron Dangloss received a telegram
from Paris, stating that King was in a hospital
there, recovering from a wound in the head.</p>

<p>&quot;You can imagine what I thought when I saw you here
a little while, ago,&quot; she said, again looking hard at his
face as if to make sure. &quot;We had looked everywhere
for you. You see, I was ashamed. That man from
Cook's told us that you were hurt by&mdash;by the way I
treated you the day before you disappeared, and&mdash;well,
he said you talked very foolishly about it.&quot;</p>

<p>He drew a long breath. Somehow he was happier than
he had been before. &quot;Hobbs is a dreadful ass,&quot; he
managed to say.</p>

<p>It seems that the ministry was curiously disturbed by
the events attending the disappearance of the Countess
Ingomede. The deception practised upon John Tullis,
frustrated only by the receipt of a genuine message
from the Countess, was enough to convince the authorities
that something serious was afoot. It may have
meant no more than the assassination of Tullis at the
hands of a jealous husband; or it may have been a part
of the vast conspiracy which Dangloss now believed
to be in progress of development.</p>

<p>&quot;Development!&quot; Truxton King had exclaimed at this
point in her narrative. &quot;Good God, if Dangloss only
knew what I know!&quot;</p>

<p>There had been a second brief message from the Countess.
She admitted that she was with her husband at
the Axphain capital. This message came to Tullis and
was to the effect that she and the Count were leaving
almost immediately for a stay at Biarritz in France.
&quot;Mr. King,&quot; said the narrator, &quot;the Countess lied. They
did not go to Biarritz. I am convinced now that she is
in the plot with that vile old man. She may even expect
to reign in Graustark some day if his plans are carried
out. I saw Count Marlanx yesterday. He was in Graustark.
I knew him by the portrait that hangs in the
Duke of Perse's house&mdash;the portrait that Ingomede always
frowns at when I mention it to her. So, they did
not go to France.&quot;</p>

<p>She was becoming excited. Her eyes flashed; she spoke
rapidly. On the morning of the 23d she had gone for
her gallop in the famous Ganlook road, attended by two
faithful grooms from the Royal stables.</p>

<p>&quot;I was in for a longer ride than usual,&quot; she said, with
sudden constraint. She looked away from her eager
listener. &quot;I was nervous and had not slept the night
before. A girl never does, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked askance. &quot;Yes?&quot; he queried.</p>

<p>She was blushing, he was sure of it. &quot;I mean a girl is
always nervous and distrait after&mdash;after she has promised,
don't you see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had promised Count Vos Engo the night before that
I&mdash;Oh, but it really has nothing to do with the story.
I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton was actually glaring at her. &quot;You mean that
you had promised to marry Count Vos Engo!&quot; he stammered.</p>

<p>&quot;We will not discuss&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But did you promise to be his wife? Is he the man
you love?&quot; he insisted. She stared at him in surprise
and no little resentment.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg of you, Mr. King&mdash;&quot; she began, but he interrupted
her.</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me. I'm a fool. Don't mind me.&quot; He sank
back against the wall, the picture of dejection. &quot;It
doesn't matter, anyway. I've got to die in a day or
two, so what's the odds?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How very strangely you talk. Are you sure&mdash;I mean,
do you think it is fever? One suffers so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He sighed deeply. &quot;Well, that's over! Whew! It
was a dream, by Jove!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please go on.&quot;</p>

<p>She waited a moment and then, looking down, said
very gently: &quot;I'm so sorry for you.&quot; He laughed, for
he thought she pitied him because he had awakened from
the dream.</p>

<p>Then she resumed her story, not to be interrupted
again. He seemed to have lost all interest.</p>

<p>She had gone six or eight miles down the Ganlook
road when she came up with five troopers of the Royal
Guard. It was a lonely spot at the junction of the King's
Highway and the road to the mines. One of the troopers
came forward and respectfully requested her to turn
off into the mine road until a detachment passed, in
charge of a gang of desperadoes taken at the Inn of
the Hawk and Raven the night before. Unsuspecting,
she rode off into the forest lane for several hundred
yards.</p>

<p>It was a trap. The men were not troopers, but brigands
gotten up in the uniform of the guard. Once
away from the main highway, they made prisoners of
her and the two grooms. Then followed a long ride
through roads new to her. At noon they came to a halt
while the rascals changed their clothing, appearing in
their true garb, that of the mountaineer. Half dead
with dread, she heard them discussing their plans; they
spoke quite freely in the presence of the well-beaten
grooms, who were led to expect death before many
hours. It was the design of the bandits to make their
way to the almost impregnable fastnesses in the hills of
Dawsbergen, the wild principality to the south. There
they could hold her against all hope of rescue, until an
immense sum of money was paid over in ransom by her
dispairing friends.</p>

<p>When night came they were high in the mountains
back of the Monastery, many hours ahead of any pursuit.
They became stupidly careless, and the two grooms
made a dash for freedom. One of them was killed, but
the other escaped. She was afterward to recall that no
effort was made to recapture him; they deliberately allowed
him to escape, their cunning purpose becoming
only too apparent later on.</p>

<p>Instead of hurrying on to Dawsbergen, they dropped
swiftly down into the valley above the city. No secret
was made of the ruse they had employed to mislead the
prospective pursuers. The rescue party, they swore
joyously, would naturally be led by John Tullis; he
would go with all haste to the Dawsbergen hills.
The word of the trusty groom would be taken as
positive proof that the captive was in that country.
She shuddered as she listened to their exultant chuckles.
It had been a most cunningly conceived plan
and it promised to result profitably for them in the
end.</p>

<p>Some time during the slow, torturing ride through the
forest she swooned. When she came to her senses she
was in a dimly lighted room, surrounded by men. The
gag had been removed from her mouth. She would
have shrieked out in her terror, had not her gaze rested
upon the figure of a man who sat opposite, his elbows on
the back of the chair which he straddled, his chin on his
arms. He was staring at her steadily, his black eyes
catching her gaze and holding it as a snake holds the
bird it has charmed.</p>

<p>She recognised the hard, hawk-like face. There could
be no mistake. She was looking into the face that made
the portrait of the Iron Count so abhorrent to her: the
leathery head of a cadaver with eyes that lived. A portrait
of Voltaire, the likeness of a satyr, a suggestion of
Satan&mdash;all rushed up from memory's storehouse to hold
her attention rapt in contemplation of this sinister
figure.</p>

<p>He smiled. It was like the crumpling of soft leather.
Then, with a word to one of the men, he abruptly left
the room. After that she broke down and cried herself
into the sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>All the next day she sat limp and helpless in the chair
they had brought to her. She could neither eat nor drink.
Late in the afternoon Marlanx came again. She knew
not from whence he came: he stood before her suddenly,
as if produced by the magic of some fabled genie, smiling
blandly, his hands clasped behind his back, his attitude
one of lecherous calculation.</p>

<p>Truxton King ground his teeth with rage and despair
while she was breathlessly repeating the suave compliments
that oozed from the lips of the tormentor.</p>

<p>&quot;He laughed when I demanded that he should restore
me to my friends. He chided me when I pleaded and
begged for mercy. My questions were never answered.
He only said that no harm was to come to me; I was
merely touching purgatory that I might better appreciate
paradise when I came to it. Oh, it was horrible!
I thought I would go mad. Finally I called him a beast;
I don't know what else I said. He merely smiled. Presently
he called one of the men into the room. He said
something about a sewer and a hole in the ground. Then
the man went out and I heard the clicking of a telegraph
instrument. I heard certain instructions. I was to be
taken to a certain place in the city at nightfall and kept
there until to-morrow night, when I am again to be removed
by way of the river. That is all I know. Where
am I, Mr. King? Oh, this dreadful place! Why are
we here&mdash;you and I?&quot;</p>

<p>King's heart throbbed fiercely one more. He was looking
straight into the piteous, wondering eyes; his gaze
fell to the parted, tremulous lips. A vast hunger possessed
his soul. In that moment he could have laid down
his life for her, with a smile of rejoicing.</p>

<p>Then he told her why she was there, why he was there&mdash;and
of the 26th. The dreadful 26th!</p>

<p>Her eyes grew wide with horror and understanding;
her bosom rose and fell rapidly with the sobs of suppressed
terror. At last he had finished his stupefying
tale; they sat side by side staring into each other's eyes,
helpless, stricken.</p>

<p>&quot;God in heaven!&quot; she repeated over and over again, in
a piteous whisper.</p>

<p>The candle flickered with feeble interest in the shadows
that began to grow in the farthest corner. The
girl drew closer to the side of the strong yet powerless
man. Their gaze went to the sputtering candle. It was
going out and they would be in utter darkness. And yet
neither thought of the supply of fresh candles in the
corner.</p>

<p>King brought himself out of the strange lethargy with
a jerk. It was high time, for the light was going.</p>

<p>&quot;Quick!&quot; he cried. &quot;The candle! Light a fresh one.
My hands are bound.&quot;</p>

<p>She crept to the candles and joined the wicks. A new
light grew as the old one died. Then she stood erect,
looking down upon him.</p>

<p>&quot;You are bound. I forgot.&quot;</p>

<p>She started forward, dropping to her knees beside
him, an eager gleam in her eyes. &quot;If I can untie the
rope&mdash;will that help? Can you do anything? You are
strong. There must be a way. There must be one little
chance for you&mdash;for us. Let me try.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove,&quot; he whispered admiringly, his spirits leaping
to meet hers. &quot;You've got pluck. You put new life in
me. I&mdash;I was almost a&mdash;a quitter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have been here so long,&quot; she explained quickly.
&quot;And tied all these days.&quot; She was tugging at the knot.</p>

<p>&quot;Only since I gave that pleasant punch to Peter
Brutus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That shows what you can do,&quot; she whispered warmly.
&quot;Oh, I wonder! I wonder if we have a chance! Anyway,
your arms will be free. I shall feel safer if your
arms are free.&quot;</p>

<p>He sat with his back to her while she struggled with
the stubborn knots. A delicious thrill of pleasure swept
over him. She had said she would feel safer if his arms
were free! She was struggling, with many a tense
straining of delicate fingers, to undo the bonds which
held him helpless. The touch of her eager fingers, the
closeness of her body, the warmth of her breathing&mdash;he
was beginning to hope that the effort might be prolonged
interminably.</p>

<p>At last, after many despairing tugs, the knot relaxed.
&quot;There!&quot; she cried, sinking back exhausted. &quot;Oh, how
it must have hurt you! Your wrists are raw!&quot;</p>

<p>He suppressed the tactless impulse to say that he preferred
a rope on the wrists to one about his neck,
realising that the jest could only shock and not amuse
her under the present conditions.</p>

<p>His arms were stiff and sore and hung like lead at his
sides. She watched him, with narrowed eyes, while he
stood off and tried to work blood and strength back into
his muscles.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think you can&mdash;can do anything now, Mr.
King?&quot; she asked, after a long interval.</p>

<p>He would not tell her how helpless he was, even with
his hands free. So he smiled bravely and sought to reassure
her with the most imposing boasts he could utter.
She began to breathe easier; the light in her eyes grew
brighter, more hopeful.</p>

<p>&quot;We must escape,&quot; she said, as if it were all settled.</p>

<p>&quot;It cannot be to-night,&quot; he gently informed her, a
sickness attacking her heart. &quot;Don't you think you'd
better try to get some sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>He prevailed upon her to lie down, with his coat for a
pillow. In two minutes she was asleep.</p>

<p>For an hour or more he sat there, looking sorrowfully
at the tired, sweet face, the utmost despair in his soul.
At last he stretched himself out on the floor, near the
door, and as he went to sleep he prayed that Providence
might open a way for him to prove that she was not
depending on him in vain.</p>

<h3>A DIVINITY SHAPES</h3>


<p>It was pitch dark when he awoke.</p>

<p>&quot;By heaven, it was a dream, after all,&quot; he murmured.
&quot;Well, thank God for that. She isn't in this damnable
hole. And,&quot; with a quickening of the blood, &quot;she hasn't
said she was going to marry Vos Engo.&quot;</p>

<p>The sound of light breathing came to his ears. He sat
up. His hands were free. It had not been a dream. She
<i>was</i> lying over there asleep. The candle had burnt itself
out, that was all. He crept softly across the floor; in
the darkness he found her, and touched the garments
she wore&mdash;and drew back enthralled. A strange joy
filled him; she was his for the time being. They were
equals in this direful, unlovely place; royal prejudice
stood for nothing here. The mad desire to pick her up
in his arms and hold her close came over him&mdash;only to
perish as quickly as it flamed. What was he thinking
of?</p>

<p>She stirred restlessly as he crept back to the door. The
sharp, quick intake of her breath told him that she was
awake. He stopped and utter silence fell upon the room.</p>

<p>A little moan escaped her lips: &quot;Who is it? Why is
it so dark? What&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is I,&quot; he whispered eagerly. &quot;King. Don't be
afraid. The candle burnt out while we were asleep. I
did not intend to sleep. I'm sorry. We can't have a
light now until some one comes in the morning. Don't
be afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid. Where are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here!&quot; He hastened to her side. As he came up she
touched his face with her hand timorously. He caught
the wayward fingers in his own and held them, drawing
quite close to her. &quot;It's all right,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Will they come soon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope not&mdash;I mean, yes; it must be morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I loathe the dark,&quot; she sighed. Presently her head
dropped over against his shoulder and she was asleep
again.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't give a damn if they never come,&quot; thought
Truxton King, intoxicated with bliss.</p>

<p>Afraid to move for fear of disturbing her, he sat there
for an hour or more his back twisted and uncomfortable,
but never so resolute. He would not have moved
for all the world.</p>

<p>All this time his brain was working like mad in the
new-found desire to perform miracles for the sake of
this lovely, unattainable creature. Was there no way
to foil these triumphant conspirators? He was forgetting
the Prince, the horrors of the 26th; he was thinking
only of saving this girl from the fate that Marlanx
had in store for her. Vos Engo may have had the
promise, but what could it profit him if Marlanx had the
girl?</p>

<p>&quot;I've got about as much chance as a snowball,&quot; he reflected,
courage and decision growing stronger each moment.
&quot;I might just as well die one way as another. If
I could only catch 'em napping for a minute, I might
turn the trick. God, that would be&mdash;&quot; he was lost in
ecstatic contemplation of the glory that such an event
would bring.</p>

<p>Footsteps in the outer room recalled him to the bitter
reality of their position. He awoke her and whispered
words of encouragement into her bewildered ears. Then
he put on his coat and threw himself on the floor, first
wrapping the rope about his wrists to deceive the
guard.</p>

<p>A key turned in the padlock and the bolt was raised.
Old man Spantz stood in the doorway, peering in at
them. In surly tones Truxton replied to his sharp
query, saying that the candle had gone out while he
slept.</p>

<p>&quot;It is noon,&quot; said the old man irascibly. Then he came
in and lighted a candle.</p>

<p>&quot;Noon of the 25th,&quot; said Truxton bitterly. &quot;In
twenty-four hours it will be all over, eh, Spantz?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At noon to-morrow,&quot; said Spantz grimly.</p>

<p>There were half a dozen men in the outer room, conversing
in low, excited tones; the fervent gesticulations
which usually marked their discussions were missing,
proving the constraint that had descended upon them.
One of them&mdash;it was Julius Spantz&mdash;brought in the
food for the prisoners, setting it on the floor between
them.</p>

<p>&quot;It is usually the duty of our friend Julius to feed
me,&quot; observed Truxton to his fellow-prisoner. &quot;I dare
say he won't mind if you relieve him of the task.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She can feed you if she likes,&quot; growled Julius.</p>

<p>&quot;Julius?&quot; queried the girl from the Castle, peering at
the man. &quot;Not Julius Spantz, of the armoury?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The same,&quot; said Truxton. Julius laughed awkwardly
and withdrew. &quot;Son of our distinguished host here.
Permit me to present Herr William&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough,&quot; snarled William Spantz, with a threatening
movement toward King. His manner changed completely,
however, when he turned to address the young
lady. &quot;I beg to inform you, madam, that your stay in
this unwholesome place is to be brief. Pray endure it
for the remainder of this day. To-night you will be
removed to more pleasant quarters, that a friend has
prepared for you. I may say to you, however, that it
will he necessary to place a gag in your mouth before
you depart. This is to be a critical night in our affairs.&quot;
He lifted an inspired gaze heavenward. &quot;Let me assure
you, madam, that the two gentlemen who are to conduct
you to the Count's&mdash;to your new quarters, are considerate,
kindly men; you need feel no further alarm. I am
requested to tell you this, so that you may rest easy for
the balance of the day. As for you, my friend,&quot; turning
to Truxton and smiling ironically, &quot;I deeply deplore
the fact that you are to remain. You may be lonesome in
the dead hours, for, as you may imagine, we, your dearest
friends, will be off about a certain business that is known
to you, if I mistake not in believing that you have
listened at the door these many nights. When we next
gather in the room beyond, a new dispensation will have
begun. You may be interested then to hear what we
have to say&mdash;out there.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton was silent for a moment, a sudden, swift
thought flooding his brain. Controlling the quiver of
anticipation in his voice, he took occasion to say:</p>

<p>&quot;I only hope you'll not forget to come back. I should
be lonesome, Spantz.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we'll not forget you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose not. By the way, would you mind telling
me what has become of your niece?&quot;</p>

<p>Spantz glared at him. &quot;She does not meet with us
now. My niece is consecrating her every thought to
the task that lies before her. You will not see her again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's an infernal shame, that's what it is,&quot; exclaimed
King, &quot;to put it all upon that poor girl! God, I'd give
ten years of my life to lead her out of this devil's mess.
She's too good for&mdash;for that. It's&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She will be out of it, as you say, to-morrow, my
excellent Samaritan. She knows.&quot; There could be no
mistake as to the meaning of the prophetic words.</p>

<p>With a profound bow to the lady and a leer for King,
he departed, bolting the door behind him. Instantly
King was at her side.</p>

<p>&quot;An idea has come to me,&quot; he whispered eagerly. &quot;I
think I see a way. By George, if it should only happen
as I hope it may!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me!&quot; she insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;Not now. I must think it all out carefully. It won't
do to get your hopes up and then fail.&quot;</p>

<p>Whatever the thought was that had come to him, it
certainly had put new life and hope into him. She nibbled
at the unwholesome food, never removing her eyes
from his tall, restless figure as he paced the floor, his
brows knit in thought. Finally he sat down beside her,
calmly helping himself to a huge slice of bread and a
boiled carrot.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never liked carrots before. I love 'em now. I'm
taking them for my complexion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't jest, Mr. King. What is it you intend to do?
Please tell me. I must know. You heard what he said
about taking me to the Count's. He meant Marlanx.
I will die first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I will die first. By the way, I may as well tell
you that I wasn't thinking altogether of how we are to
escape. There was something else on my mind.&quot; He
stopped and looked at her puzzled face. &quot;Why should
I save you from Marlanx just to have you hurry off
and get married to Vos Engo? It's a mean thought, I
know,&quot; hastily, &quot;and unworthy of a typical hero, but,
just the same, I hate to think of you marrying some
one&mdash;else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some one else?&quot; she questioned, a pucker on her forehead.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know I wouldn't have a ghost of a chance, even
if there wasn't a Vos Engo. It isn't that,&quot; he explained.
&quot;I recognise the&mdash;er&mdash;difference in our stations
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you crazy, Mr. King?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not now. I was a bit touched, I think, but I'm over
it now. I dare say it was caused by excessive reading
of improbable romances. Life rather takes it out of a
fellow, don't you know. It's all simple enough in books,
but in&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What has all this got to do with your plan to escape?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing at all. It merely has to do with my ambition
to become a true hero. You see, I'm an amateur hero.
Of course, this is good practice for me; in time, I may
become an expert and have no difficulty in winning a
duchess or even a princess. Don't misunderstand me.
I intend to do all I can toward rescuing you to-night.
The point I'm trying to get at is this: don't you think
it's pretty rough on a hero to save the girl for some
other fellow to snap up and marry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I begin to see,&quot; she said, a touch of pink
coming into her cheeks.</p>

<p>&quot;That's encouraging,&quot; he said, staring gloomily at the
food he had put aside. &quot;You are quite sure you
promised Vos Engo that you'd marry him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I did not promise him that I'd marry him,&quot; she
said, leaning back and surveying him between narrowed
lids.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon. You said you had promised&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did not allow me time to finish. I meant to say
that I had promised to let him know in a day or two.
That is all, Mr. King.&quot; There was a suspicious tremor
in her voice and her gaze wavered beneath his unbelieving
stare.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot; he demanded. &quot;You&mdash;you don't mean
to say that&mdash;Oh, Lord! I wonder! I wonder if I have
a chance&mdash;just a ghost of a chance?&quot; He leaned very
close, incredulous, fascinated. &quot;What is it that you
are going to let him know? Yes or no?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was the question I was considering when the
brigands caught me,&quot; she answered, meeting his gaze
fairly. &quot;I haven't thought of it since.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, he is in your own class,&quot; said Truxton
glumly.</p>

<p>She hesitated an instant, her face growing very serious.
&quot;Mr. King, has no one told you my name&mdash;who I am?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;You are the Prince's aunt, that's all I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No more his aunt in reality than Jack Tullis is his
uncle. I thought you understood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who are you, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am Jack Tullis's sister, a New Yorker bred and
born, and I live not more than two blocks from
your&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the love of&mdash;&quot; he began blankly; then words
failed him, which was just as well. He gulped twice,
joy or unbelief choking him. The smile that crept into
her face dazzled him; he stared at her in speechless
amazement. &quot;Then&mdash;then, you are not a duchess or
a&mdash;&quot; he began again.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. A very plain New Yorker,&quot; she said,
laughing aloud in sudden hysteria. For some reason she
drew quickly away from him. &quot;You are not disappointed,
are you? Does it spoil your romance to&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spoil it? Disappointed? No! By George, I&mdash;I
can't believe that any such luck&mdash;no, no, I don't mean it
just that way! Let me think it out. Let me get it
through my head.&quot; He leaned back against the wall
and devoured her with eager, disturbing eyes. &quot;You are
Tullis's sister? You live near&mdash;Oh, I say, this is glorious!&quot;
He arose and took a turn about the room. In
some nervousness and uncertainty she also came to her
feet, watching him wonderingly. He hurried back to
her, a new light in his eyes. She was very desirable,
this slender, uncertain person in the crumpled grey.</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Tullis,&quot; he said, a thrill in his voice, &quot;you are
a princess, just the same. I never was so happy in my
life as I am this minute. It isn't so black as it was. I
thought I couldn't win you because you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Win me?&quot; she gasped, her lips parted in wonder.</p>

<p>&quot;Precisely. Now I'm looking at it differently. I
don't mind telling you that I'm in love with you&mdash;desperately
in love. It's been so with me ever since that
day in the Park. I loved you as a duchess or a princess,
and without hope. Now, I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I'm going to
hope. Perhaps Vos Engo has the better of me just now,
but I'm in the lists with him&mdash;with all of them. If I
get you out of this place&mdash;and myself as well&mdash;I want
you to understand that from this very minute I am
trying to win you if it lies in the power of any American
to win a girl who has suitors among the nobility. Will&mdash;will
you give me a chance&mdash;just a ghost of a chance?
I'll try to do the rest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are&mdash;are you really in earnest?&quot; she murmured, composure
flying to the winds.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; terribly so,&quot; he said gently. &quot;I mean every word
of it. I do love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I cannot talk about it now, Mr. King,&quot; she fluttered,
moving away from him in a sudden panic. Presently
he went over to her. She was standing near the
candle, staring down at the flame with a strangely preoccupied
expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he said. &quot;I was hasty, inconsiderate. I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You quite took my breath away,&quot; she panted, looking
up at him with a queer little smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>Her troubled gaze resumed its sober contemplation of
the flame.</p>

<p>&quot;How was I to tell&mdash;&quot; she began, but checked herself.
&quot;Please, Mr. King, you won't say anything more to me
about&mdash;about it,&mdash;just now, will you? Shall we talk
of our plans for to-night? Tell me about them.&quot;</p>

<p>He lowered his eyes, suddenly disheartened. &quot;I only
ask you to believe that I am desperately in earnest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot comprehend how&mdash;I mean, it is so very wonderful.
You don't think me unappreciative, or mean,
do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not. You are startled, that's all. I'm a
blundering fool. Still, you must agree that I was
frightfully bowled over when I found that you were not
what I thought. I couldn't hold back, that's all. By
Jove, isn't it wonderful? Here I've been looking all
over the world for you, only to find that you've been
living around the corner from me all these years! It's
positively staggering! Why,&quot; with a sudden burst of
his unquenchable buoyancy, &quot;we might have been married
two years ago and saved all this trouble. Just think
of it!&quot;</p>

<p>She smiled. &quot;I do like you,&quot; she said warmly, giving
him her hand. He kissed it gallantly and stepped back&mdash;resolutely.</p>

<p>&quot;That's something,&quot; he said with his humblest, most
conquering smile.</p>

<p>&quot;You won't leave me to my fate because you think I'm
going to marry&mdash;some one else?&quot;</p>

<p>He grew very sober. &quot;Miss Tullis, you and I have one
chance in a thousand. You may as well know the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I can't bear the thought of that dreadful old
man,&quot; she cried, abject distress in her eyes.</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth and turned away. She went back
to the corner, dully rearranging the coat he had given
her for comfort. She handled it with a tenderness that
would have astonished the garment had it been capable
of understanding. For a long time she watched him in
silence as he paced to and fro like a caged lion. Twice
she heard him mutter: &quot;An American girl&mdash;good
Lord,&quot; and she found herself smiling to herself&mdash;the
strange, vagrant smile that comes of wonder and self-gratification.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon&mdash;long hours in which they had
spoken to each other with curious infrequency, each
a prey to sombre thoughts&mdash;their door was unlocked
and Anna Cromer appeared before them, accompanied
by two of the men. Crisply she commanded the girl to
come forth; she wanted to talk with her.</p>

<p>She was in the outer room for the better part of an
hour, listening to Anna Cromer and Madame Drovnask,
who dinned the praises of the great Count Marlanx into
her ears until she was ready to scream. They bathed
the girl's face and brushed her hair and freshened her
garments. It occurred to her that she was being prepared
for a visit of the redoubtable Marlanx himself,
and put the question plainly.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Anna Cromer. &quot;He's not coming here.
You are going to him. He will not be Count Marlanx
after to-morrow, but Citizen Marlanx&mdash;one of the
people, one of us. Ah, he is a big man to do this.&quot;</p>

<p>Little did they know Marlanx!</p>

<p>&quot;Julius and Peter will come for you to-night,&quot; said
Madame Drovnask, with an evil, suggestive smile. &quot;We
will not be here to say farewell, but, my dear, you will
be one of us before&mdash;well, before many days have
passed.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton was beginning to tremble with the fear that
she would not be returned to their room, when the door
was opened and she came in&mdash;most gladly, he could see.
The two women bade him a cool, unmistakable <i>Good-bye</i>,
and left him in charge of the men who had just come
down from the shop above.</p>

<p>For half an hour Peter Brutus taunted him. It was
all he could do to keep his hands wrapped in the rope
behind his back; he was thankful when they returned
him to his cell. The time was not ripe for the dash he
was now determined to make.</p>

<p>&quot;Get a little nap, if you can,&quot; he said to Loraine, when
the door was locked behind him. &quot;It won't be long before
something happens. I've got a plan. You'll have
your part to play. God grant that it may work out
well for us. You&mdash;you might pray if&mdash;if&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I <i>can</i> pray,&quot; she said simply. &quot;I'll do my part,
Mr. King.&quot;</p>

<p>He waited a moment. &quot;We've been neighbours in New
York for years,&quot; he said. &quot;Would you mind calling me
Truxton,&mdash;and for Adele's sake, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It isn't hard to do, Truxton.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She rebelled at the mere thought of sleep, but, unfastening
her collar and removing the jabot, she made
herself a comfortable cushion of his coat and sat back
in her corner, strangely confident that this strong, eager
American would deliver her from the Philistines&mdash;this
fighting American with the ten days' growth of beard
on his erstwhile merry face.</p>

<p>Sometime in the tense, suffocating hours of the night
they heard the sounds of many footsteps shuffling about
the outer room; there were hoarse, guttural, subdued
good-byes and well-wishes, the creaking of heavy doors
and the dropping of bolts. Eventually King, who had
been listening alertly, realised that but two of the men
remained in the room&mdash;Peter Brutus and Julius Spantz.</p>

<p>An hour crept by, and another, seemingly interminable
King was fairly groaning under the suspense. The
time was slowly, too slowly approaching when he was
to attempt the most desperate act in all this sanguinary
tragedy&mdash;the last act for him, no doubt, but the one
in which he was to see himself glorified.</p>

<p>There remained the chance&mdash;the slim chance that only
Providence considers. He had prayed for strength and
cunning; she had prayed for divine intervention. But,
after all, Luck was to be the referee.</p>

<p>He had told her of his plan; she knew the part she was
to play. And if all went well&mdash;ah, then! He took a
strange lesson in the language of Graustark: one sentence,
that was all. She had whispered the translation
to him and he had grimly repeated it, over and over
again. &quot;She has fainted, damn her!&quot; It was to be their
&quot;Open Sesame&quot;&mdash;if all went well!</p>

<p>Suddenly he started to his feet, his jaws set, his eyes
gleaming. The telegraph instrument was clicking in
the outer room!</p>

<p>He had wrapped his handkerchief about his big right
hand, producing a sort of cushion to deaden the sound
of a blow with the fist and to protect his knuckles; for
all his strength was to go into that one mighty blow. If
both men came into the room, his chance was smaller;
but, in either event, the first blow was to be a mighty
one.</p>

<p>Taking his position near the girl, who was crouching
in real dismay, he leaned against the wall, his hands behind
him, every muscle strained and taut.</p>

<p>The door opened and Julius Spantz, bewhiskered and
awkward, entered. He wore a raincoat and storm hat,
and carried a rope in one of his hands. He stopped just
inside the door to survey the picture.</p>

<p>&quot;Time you were asleep,&quot; he said stupidly, addressing
King.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd put you to sleep, Julius, if Miss Tullis could have
managed to untie these infernal bonds,&quot; said Truxton,
with pleasant daring.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't tie lovers' knots,&quot; grinned Julius, pleased with
his own wit. &quot;Come, madam, I must ask you to stand
up. Will you put your own handkerchief in your mouth,
or must I use force&mdash;ah, that's good! I'm sorry, but
I must wrap this cloth about&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He did not complete the sentence, for he had come
within range. The whole weight of Truxton King's
body was behind the terrific blow that landed on the
man's jaw. Loraine suppressed the scream that rose to
her white lips. Julius Spantz's knees crumpled; he
lunged against the wall and was sliding down when King
caught him in his arms. The man was stunned beyond
all power of immediate action. It was the work of an
instant to snatch the revolver from his coat pocket.</p>

<p>&quot;Guard the door!&quot; whispered King to the girl, pressing
the revolver into her hand. &quot;And shoot if you have
to!&quot;</p>

<p>A handkerchief was stuffed into the unconscious man's
mouth; the long coat and boots were jerked from his
limp body before his hands and feet were bound with the
rope he carried; the bushy whiskers and wig were removed
from his head and transferred in a flash to that
of the American. Then the boots, coat and hat found
a new wearer.</p>

<p>Peter Brutus was standing in the stairway, leading to
the sewer, listening eagerly for sounds from either side.</p>

<p>&quot;Hurry up, Julius,&quot; he called imperatively. &quot;They
are below with the boat. They have given the signal.&quot;</p>

<p>The new Julius uttered a single sentence; that was all.
If Peter heard the noise attending the disposal of his
comrade, he was justified in believing that the girl had
offered some resistance. When a tall, grunting man
emerged from the inner room, bearing the limp figure
of a girl in a frayed raincoat, he did not wait to ask
questions, but rushed over and locked the cell-door. Then
he led the way down the narrow stairway, lighting the
passage with a candle. His only reply to King's guttural
remark in the Graustark language was:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't speak, you fool! Not a word until we reach
the river.&quot;</p>

<p>Down the steps they went to the opening in the wall of
the sewer. There, before the bolts were drawn by Brutus,
a series of raps were exchanged by men outside and
the one who held the keys within.</p>

<p>A moment later, the girl was being lowered through the
hole into rough, eager arms. Brutus and his companion
dropped through, the secret block of masonry
was closed, and off through the shallow waters of the
sewer glided the party riverward in the noiseless boat
that had come up to ferry them.</p>

<p>There were three men in the boat, not counting Truxton
King.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV" />CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>ON THE RIVER</h3>


<p>No word was spoken during this cautious, extraordinary
voyage underground. The boat drifted slowly through
the narrow channel, unlighted and practically unguided.
Two of the men sat at the rowlocks, but the oars rested
idly in the boat. With their hands they kept the craft
from scraping against the walls.</p>

<p>The pseudo-Julius supported his charge in the stern
of the boat; Peter Brutus sat in the bow, a revolver in
his hand, his gaze bent upon the opaqueness ahead. A
whispered word of encouragement now and then passed
from the lips of the hopeful American into the ear of the
almost pulseless girl, who lay up against his knee.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll do it&mdash;sure!&quot; he whispered once, ever so softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she scarcely, breathed, but he heard and was
thrilled. The rope had dropped from her arms; she
had taken the handkerchief from her mouth at his whispered
command.</p>

<p>At last the boat crept out into the rainy, starless night.
He drew the skirts of his own mackintosh over her
shoulders and head. A subdued command came from the
man in the bow; the oars slipped into the deep, black
waters of the river; without a splash or a perceptible
sound the little craft scudded toward midstream. The
night was so inky black that one could not see his hand
before his face.</p>

<p>At least two of the occupants opened up their throats
and lungs and gulped in the wet, fresh air. Never had
anything been so glorious to Truxton King as these first
tremendous inhalations of pure, free air. She felt his
muscles expand; his whole body grew stronger and more
vital. Her heart was pounding violently against his
leg; he could feel its throbs, he could hear the quick,
eager panting of her breath.</p>

<p>It was now that he began to wonder, to calculate
against the plans of their silent escort. Whither were
they bound? When would his chance come to strike
the final, surprising blow? Only the greatest effort at
self-control kept him from ruining everything by premature
action; his exultation was getting the better of
him. Coolness and patience were greater assets now
than strength and daring.</p>

<p>The boat turned in mid-stream and shot swiftly up the
river, past the black fortress with its scattered sentry
lights, where slept a garrison in sweet ignorance of the
tragedy that was to come upon them when the sun was
high. The lights of the city itself soon peeped down
into the rain-swept waters; music from the distant caf&eacute;s
came faintly to the ears of the midnight voyagers. A
safe haven at their very elbows, and yet unattainable.</p>

<p>The occasional creak of an oar, a whispered oath of
dismay, the heavy breathing of toilers, the soft blowing
of the mist-that was all; no other sound on the broad,
still river. It was, indeed, a night fit for the undertaking
at hand.</p>

<p>Truxton began to chafe under the strain. His uneasiness
was increased by the certain conviction that before
long they would be beyond the city, the walls of
which were gradually slipping past He could not even
so much as guess at their destination. There was also
the likelihood of encountering reinforcements, sent out
to meet the boatmen, or for protection at the time of
landing. A hundred doubts and misgivings assailed
him. To suddenly open fire on the rascals went against
the grain. A dashing, running fight on shore was more
to his liking. An ill-timed move would foil them even as
success was in their grasp.</p>

<p>He considered their chances if he were to overturn the
frail boat and strike out for shore in the darkness. This
project he gave up at once: he did not know the waters
nor the banks between which they glided. They were
past the walls now and rowing less stealthily. Before
long they would be in a position to speak aloud; it
would be awkward for him. The situation was rapidly
growing more and more desperate; the time was near at
hand when the final effort would have to be exerted. He
slipped the revolver from his pocket; somehow he was
unable to keep his teeth from chattering; but it was
through excitement, not fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boat turned to the right and shot toward
the unseen bank. They were perhaps half a mile above
the city wall. Truxton's mind was working like a trip-hammer.
He was recalling a certain nomad settlement
north of the city, the quarters of fishermen, poachers and
horse-traders: a squalid, unclean community that lay
under the walls between the northern gates and the
river. These people, he was not slow to surmise, were
undoubtedly hand in glove with Marlanx, if not so
surely connected with the misguided Committee of Ten.
This being the eve of the great uprising, it was not
unlikely that a secret host lay here awake and ready for
the foul observance of the coming holiday; here, at
least, chafed an eager, vicious, law-hating community
of mendicants and outcasts.</p>

<p>He had little time to speculate on the attitude of the
denizens of this unwholesome place. The prow of the
boat grated on the pebbly bank, and Peter Brutus
leaped over the edge into the shallow water.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Julius&mdash;hand her over to me!&quot; he cried,
making his way to the stern.</p>

<p>As he leaned over the side to seize the girl in his arms,
Truxton King brought the butt of the heavy revolver
down upon his skull. Brutus dropped across the gunwale
with a groan, dead to all that was to happen in the
next half hour or more.</p>

<p>King was anxious to avoid the hullaballoo that shooting
was sure to create on shore. Action had been forced
upon him rather precipitously, but he was ready. Leaning
forward, he had the two amazed oarsmen covered
with the weapon.</p>

<p>&quot;Hands up! Quick!&quot; he cried. Two pairs of hands
went up, together with strange oaths. Truxton's eyes
had grown used to the darkness; he could see the men
quite plainly. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he demanded of
Loraine, who, behind him, was fumbling in the garments
of the unconscious Brutus.</p>

<p>&quot;Getting his revolver,&quot; she replied, with a quaver in
her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Good!&quot; he said exultantly. &quot;Let's think a minute,&quot;
he went on. &quot;We don't dare turn these fellows loose,
even if we disarm them. They'll have a crowd after us
in two minutes.&quot; Still, keeping the men covered, he
cudgelled his brain for the means of disposing of them.
&quot;I have it. We must disarm them, tie them up and set
'em adrift. Do you mind getting out into the water?
It's ankle deep, that's all. I'll keep them covered while
you take their guns.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nice way to treat a friend,&quot; growled one of the men.</p>

<p>&quot;A friend? By George, it's my Newport acquaintance.
Well, this is a pleasure! I suppose you know that I'll
shoot if you resist. Better take it quietly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you'll shoot, all right,&quot; said the other. &quot;I told
them damn fools that a Yankee'd get the better of 'em,
even if they ran a steam roller over him two or three
times. Say, you're a pippin! I'd like to take off my
hat to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't bother. I acknowledge the tribute.&quot;</p>

<p>Loraine Tullis was in the water by this time. With
nervous haste she obeyed King's instructions; the big
revolvers were passed back to him.</p>

<p>&quot;I've changed my mind,&quot; said Truxton' suddenly.
&quot;We'll keep the boat. Get in, Miss Tullis. There!
Now, push off, Newport.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the devil&mdash;&quot; began Newport, but King silenced
him. The boat slowly drifted out into the current.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, row!&quot; he commanded. With his free hand he
reached back and dragged the limp Brutus into the
boat. &quot;'Gad, I believe he's dead,&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p>For five minutes the surly oarsmen pulled away, headed
in the direction from which they came.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you swim?&quot; demanded King.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a stroke,&quot; gasped Newport. &quot;Good Lord, pal,
you're not going to dump us overboard. It's ten feet
deep along here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pull on your left, hard. That's right. I'm going
to land you on the opposite shore-and then bid you a
cheerful good-night.&quot;</p>

<p>Two minutes later they ran up under the western bank
of the stream, which at this point was fully three hundred
yards wide. The nearest bridge was a mile and a
half away and habitations were scarce, as he well knew.
Under cover of the deadly revolver, the two men dropped
into the water, which was above their waists; the limp
form of Peter Brutus was pulled out and transferred to
the shoulders of his companions.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; called out Truxton King cheerily. He
had grasped the oars; the little boat leaped off into the
night, leaving the cursing desperadoes waist-deep in the
chilly waters.</p>

<p>&quot;See you later,&quot; sang out Newport, with sudden
humour.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll go south,&quot; said Truxton King to the girl who
sat in the stern, clutching the sides of the boat with
tense fingers. &quot;I don't know just where we'll land, but
it won't be up in Devil's Patch, you may rest assured of
that. Pardon me if I do not indulge in small talk and
bonmots; I'm going to be otherwise employed for some
time, Miss Tullis. Do you know the river very well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; she replied. &quot;I only know that the barge
docks are below here somewhere. I'm sure we can get
into the city if we can find the docks. Let me take the
oars, too, Mr. King. I can row.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Please sit where you are and keep your eyes
ahead. Can you see where we're going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can see the lights. We're in mid-stream, I think.
It's so very dark and the wind is coming up in a gale.
It's&mdash;it's going to storm. Don't you think we'd better
try for a landing along the walls? They say the river is
very treacherous.&quot; She was trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll row over to the east side, but I don't like to get
too close to the walls. Some one may have heard the
shouts of our friends back there.&quot;</p>

<p>Not another word passed between them for ten or
twelve minutes. She peered anxiously ahead, looking for
signs of the barge dock, which lay somewhere along this
section of the city wall. In time, of course, the marooned
desperadoes might be expected to find a way to
pursue them, or, at least, to alarm watchful confederates
on the city side of the river. It was a tense, anxious
quarter of an hour for the liberated pair. So near to
absolute safety, and yet so utterly in the dark as to
what the next moment, might develop&mdash;weal or woe.</p>

<p>At least the sound of rapidly working rowlocks came
to the girl's ears. They were slipping along in the dense
blackness beneath the walls, making as little noise as
possible and constantly on the lookout for the long,
low dock.</p>

<p>&quot;They're after us,&quot; grated Truxton, in desperation.
&quot;They've got word to friends one way or another. By
Jove! I'm nearly fagged, too. I can't pull much farther.
Hello! What's this?&quot;</p>

<p>The side of the boat caromed off' a solid object in the
water, almost spilling them into the wind-blown river.</p>

<p>&quot;The docks!&quot; she whispered. &quot;We struck a small
scow, I think. Can you find your way in among the
coal barges?&quot;</p>

<p>He paddled along slowly, feeling his way, scraping
alongside the big barges which delivered coal from the
distant mines to the docks along the river front. At
last he found an opening and pushed through. A moment
later they were riding under the stern of a broad,
cargoless barge, plumb up against the water-lapped
piles of the dock.</p>

<p>Standing in the bow of the boat he managed to pull
himself up over the slippery edge. It was the work of a
second to draw her up after him. With an oar which
he had thought to remove beforehand, he gave the boat
a mighty shove, sending it out into the stream once
more.</p>

<p>Then, hand in hand, they edged slowly, carefully along
the gravel-strewn dock, between vast piles of lumber and
steep walls of coal. It was only necessary to find the
railway company's runways leading into the yards
above; in time of peace there was little likelihood that
the entrances to the dock would be closed, even at night.</p>

<p>Loud curses came up from the river, proclaiming the
fact that the pursuers had found the empty boat. Afterwards
they were to learn that &quot;Newport's&quot; shouts had
brought a boatload of men from the opposite bank,
headed by the innkeeper, in whose place Loraine was to
have encountered Marlanx later on, if plans had not miscarried.
She was to have remained in this outside inn
until after the sacking of the city on the following day.
The girl translated one remark that came up to them
from the boatload of pursuers:</p>

<p>&quot;The old man is waiting back there. He'll kill the lot
of us if we don't bring the girl.&quot;</p>

<p>By this time King had located the open space which
undoubtedly afforded room for the transfer of cargoes
from the dock to the company's yards inside the walls.
Without hesitation he drew her after him up this wide,
sinister roadway. They stumbled on over the rails of the
&quot;dummy track,&quot; collided with collier trucks, slipped on
the soggy chutes, but all the while forged ahead toward
the gates that so surely lay above them.</p>

<p>The pursuers were trying for a landing, noisily, even
boisterously. It struck Truxton as queer that these
men were not afraid of alarming the watchmen on the
docks or the man at the gate above. Suddenly it came
to him that there would be no one there to oppose the
landing of the miscreants. No doubt hundreds of men
already had stolen through these gates during the night,
secreting themselves in the fastnesses of the city, ready
for the morrow's fray. It is no small wonder that he
shuddered at the thought of it.</p>

<p>There was no one on the wharf&mdash;at least, no one in
sight. They rushed up the narrow railway chutes and
through one of the numerous gateways that opened out
upon the barge docks. No one opposed them; no one
was standing guard. From behind came the sound of
rushing footsteps. Lightning flashed in the sky and
the rumble of thunder broke over the desolate night.</p>

<p>&quot;They'll see us by the lightning,&quot; gasped Truxton,
almost ready to drop from faintness and exhaustion.
He was astounded, even alarmed, to find that his strength
had been so gravely depleted by confinement and lack
of nourishment.</p>

<p>They were inside the city walls. Ahead of them, in
that labyrinth of filthy streets lay the way to the distant
square. His arm was now about her waist, for she
was half-fainting; he could hear her gasping and moaning
softly, inarticulate cries of despair. Switch-lights
blinked in the distance. Off to the right of them windows
showed lights; the clang of a locomotive bell came
to them as from a great distance.</p>

<p>Their progress was abruptly halted by the appearance
of a man ahead, standing like a statue in the middle of
the network of tracks. They stumbled toward him, not
knowing whether he was friend or foe. One look into
their faces, aided by the flare of a yardman's lantern,
and the fellow turned tail and fled, shouting as he did
so.</p>

<p>Following a vivid flash of lightning, two shots were
fired by the men who were now plunging up through the
gates, a hundred yards or more away. The same flash
of lightning showed to King the narrow, muddy street
that stretched ahead of them, lined with low, ugly houses
of a nondescript character. Instead of doing the obvious
thing, he turned sharply to the left, between the
lines of freight cars. Their progress was slow; both
were ready to drop; the way was dark and unknown to
them.</p>

<p>At last they came to the end of their rope: they were
literally up against the great city wall! They had
reached the limits of the railway yards and were blocked
on all sides by they knew not how many rows of cars.
Somewhere off to the right there were streets and houses
and people, but they did not have the strength to try to
reach them.</p>

<p>A car door stood open in front of them. He waited
for a second flash of lightning to reveal to him the nature
of its interior. It was quite empty. Without
hesitation he clambered in and pulled her up after him.
They fell over, completely fagged.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the storm broke. He managed to
close the door against the driving torrents.</p>

<p>She was sobbing plaintively, poor, wet, bedraggled
sweetheart&mdash;he called her that, although she did not hear
him.</p>

<p>&quot;We've fooled them,&quot; he managed to whisper, close to
her ear. &quot;They won't look here. You're safe, Loraine.
'Gad, I'd like to see any one get you away from me
now.&quot;</p>

<p>She pressed his arm, that was all. He found himself
wondering what answer she would give to Vos Engo
when he took her to him to-morrow. To-morrow! This
was the 26th! Would there be a to-morrow for any of
them&mdash;for Vos Engo, for Tullis, for the Prince? For
<i>her</i>?</p>

<p>&quot;There will be time to warn them in the morning,&quot; he
thought, dulled by fatigue. &quot;We can't go on now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Truxton,&quot; he heard her saying, tremulously, &quot;do you
think we can do anything for them&mdash;the Prince and
those who are with him? How can we lie here when
there is so much to be done?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When the storm abates&mdash;when we are rested&mdash;we
will try to get away from here. Those devils know that
I will give the alarm. They will have hundreds of men
watching to head us off. It means everything to them.
You see, I know their plans. But, Loraine, dear little
girl, brave as you are and willing as I am, we can't go
on until we've pulled ourselves together. We're safe
here for awhile. Later on, we'll try to steal up to the
city. They will be watching every approach to the
Castle and to the Tower, hoping to stop me in time.
We must out-fox them again. It will be harder, too,
little girl. But, if I don't do any more, I pledge you
that I'll save you from Marlanx.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know you will. You must, Truxton.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd&mdash;I'd like to be sure that I am also saving you
from Vos Engo. I hate to think of you throwing yourself
away on one of these blithering, fortune-hunting
noblemen.&quot; She pressed his arm again. &quot;By Jove, it's
great fun being a hero, after all&mdash;and it isn't so difficult,
if the girl helps you as you helped me. It's too
bad I couldn't do it all by myself. I have always counted
on rescuing you from an Ogre's castle or something of
that sort. It's rather commonplace as it is, don't you
think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't&mdash;know what&mdash;you're talking about,&quot; she
murmured. Then she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>The storm raged; savage bursts of wind rocked the
little freight car; the rain hissed viciously against their
frail hotel; thunder roared and lightning rent sky and
earth. The weary night-farers slept with pandemonium
dinning in their ears.</p>

<p>He sat with his back against the side of the car, a,
pistol in one hand, the other lying tenderly upon the
drenched hair of the girl whose head rested upon his
leg. She had slipped down from his shoulder; he did
not have the desire or the energy to prevent it. At his
side lay the discarded whiskers. Manfully as he had
fought against the impelling desire to sleep, he could not
beat it off. His last waking thought was of the effort
he must make to reach Dangloss with the warning.</p>

<p>Then the storm abated; the soft drip of rain from the
eaves of the car beat a monotonous tattoo in the pools
below; the raw winds from the mountains blew stealthily
in the wake of the tornado, picking up the waste that
had been left behind only to cast it aside with a moan
of derision.</p>

<p>Something stirred in the far end of the car. A still,
small noise as of something alive that moved with the
utmost wariness. A heavy, breathing body crept
stealthily across the intervening space; so quietly that
a mouse could have made but little less noise.</p>

<p>Then it stopped; there was not a sound inside the car
except the deep, regular breathing of Truxton King.
The girl's respiration was so faint that one might have
thought she did not breathe at all. Again the sly, cautious
movement of a heavy body; the creaking of a joint
or two, the sound of a creature rising from a crouching
position to the upright; then the gentle rubbing of
cloth, the fumbling of fingers in a stubborn pocket.</p>

<p>An instant later the bluish flame of a sulphur match
struggled for life, growing stronger and brighter in the
hand of a man who stood above the sleepers.</p>

<h3>THE GIRL IN THE RED CLOAK</h3>


<p>Inside of an hour after the return of the frightened,
quivering groom who had escaped from the brigands in
the hills, Jack Tullis was granted permission by the war
department to take a hundred picked men with him in the
effort to overtake and capture the abductors of his sister.
The dazed groom's story hardly had been told to the
horrified brother before he was engaged in telephoning
to General Braze and Baron Dangloss. A hurried consultation
followed. Other affairs that had been troubling
the authorities for days were forgotten in the face
of this distressing catastrophe; there was no time to be
lost if the desperadoes were to be headed before they succeeded
in reaching the Dawsbergen passes with their
lovely captive. Once there, it would be like hunting a
needle in a haystack; they could elude pursuit for days
among the wild crags of upper Dawsbergen, where none
but outlaws lived, and fierce beasts thrived.</p>

<p>Unluckily for the dearest hopes of the rescuing party,
the miserable groom did not reach the city until almost
noon of the day following the abduction. He had lost
his way and had wandered all night in the forests. When
Miss Tullis failed to return at nightfall, her brother,
having in mind the mysterious disappearance of Truxton
King and the flight of Countess Ingomede, was preparing
to set forth in search of her. A telephone message
from Ganlook, fifteen miles north of the city, came
at seven o'clock, just as he was leaving the Castle. The
speaker purported to be the Countess Prandeville, a very
estimable chatelaine who ruled socially over the grim old
village of Ganlook. She informed Tullis that his sister
was with her for the night, having arrived in the afternoon
with a &quot;frightful headache.&quot; She would look after
the dear child, of whom she was very fond, and would
send her down in the morning, when she would surely be
herself again. Greatly relieved, Tullis gave up his plan
to ride off in quest of her; he knew the amiable Countess,
and felt that his sister was in good hands.</p>

<p>It was not until the return of the groom that he recalled
the fact that the voice on the telephone was not
quite like that of the Countess. He had been cleverly
hoodwinked. Baron Dangloss, obtaining connection
with the Prandeville household in Ganlook, at once discovered
that Loraine had not been in the chateau in
many days.</p>

<p>The fierce, cock-robin baron was sadly upset. Three
prominent persons had been stolen from beneath his nose,
so to speak. He was beside himself with rage and dismay.
This last outrage was the climax. The old man
adored the sister of Jack Tullis; he was heartbroken and
crushed by the news of the catastrophe. For a while he
worked as if in a daze; only the fierce spurring of Jack
Tullis and Vos Engo, who believed himself to be an accepted
suitor, awoke him from an unusual state of
lethargy. It is even said that the baron shed tears without
blowing his nose to discredit the emotion.</p>

<p>The city was soon to know of the fresh outrage at the
hands of the bandits in the hills. Great excitement prevailed;
there were many sincere lamentations, for the
beautiful American girl was a great favourite&mdash;especially
with those excellent persons who conducted bazaars in
the main avenues. Loraine, being an American, did not
hesitate to visit the shops in person: something that the
native ladies never thought of doing. Hundreds of
honest citizens volunteered to join in a search of the
hills, but the distinction was denied them.</p>

<p>The war department issued official notice to all merchants
that their places of business must be decorated
properly against the holiday that would occur on the
morrow. Shops were to be closed for two hours at midday,
during the ceremonies attending the unveiling of
the Yetive monument in the Plaza. The merchants
might well give their time to decorating their shops;
the soldiers could do all the searching and all the fighting
that was necessary. Strict orders, backed by
method, were issued to the effect that no one was to pass
through the gates during the day, except by special
permission from General Braze.</p>

<p>Count Vos Engo was eager to accompany the expedition
to Dawsbergen in search of his wayward lady-love.
Tullis, who liked the gay young nobleman despite the
reputation he had managed to live down, was willing that
he should be the one to lead the troops, but Colonel
Quinnox flatly refused to consider it.</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrow's celebration in the city will demand the
attendance of every noble officer in the guard,&quot; he said.
&quot;I cannot allow you to go, Count Vos Engo. Your
place is here, beside the Prince. Line officers may take
charge of this expedition to the hills; they will be amply
able to manage the chase. I am sorry that it happens
so. The Royal Guard, to a man, must ride with the
Prince to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Captain Haas, of the dragoons, was put in charge of
the relief party, much to the disgust of Vos Engo;
and at two o'clock in the afternoon they were ready to
ride away. The party was armed and equipped for a
bitter chase. Word had been sent to Serros, the capital
of Dawsbergen, asking the assistance of Prince Dantan
in the effort to overtake the abductors. A detachment,
it was announced in reply, was to start from Serros during
the afternoon, bound for the eastern passes.</p>

<p>Baron Dangloss rode to the southern gate with the
white-faced, suffering Tullis. &quot;We will undoubtedly receive
a communication from the rascals this afternoon
or to-morrow,&quot; he said gloomily. &quot;They will not be
slow to make a formal demand for ransom, knowing that
you and your sister are possessed of unlimited wealth.
When this communication arrives it may give us a clue
to their whereabouts; certainly as to their methods. If
it should be necessary, Tullis, to apprise you of the
nature of this demand, I, myself, will ride post haste
to St. Michael's Pass, which you are bound to reach to-morrow
after your circuit of the upper gaps. It is
possible, you see, that an open attack on these fellows
may result in her&mdash;er&mdash;well, to be frank&mdash;her murder.
Damn them, they'd do it, you know. My place to-morrow
is here in the city. There may be disturbances.
Nothing serious, of course, but I am uneasy. There are
many strangers in the city and more are coming for the
holiday. The presence of the Prince at the unveiling of
the statue of his mother&mdash;God bless her soul!&mdash;is a
tremendous magnet. I would that you could be here
to-morrow, John Tullis; at Prince Robin's side, so to
speak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor little chap! He was terribly cut up when I told
him I was going. He wanted to come. Had his little
sword out, and all that. Said the celebration could be
postponed or go hang, either one. Look after him
closely to-morrow, Dangloss. I'd shoot myself if anything
were to happen to him. Marlanx is in the air; I
feel him, I give you my word, I do! I've been depressed
for days. As sure as there's a sun up yonder, that old
scoundrel is planning something desperate. Don't forget
that we've already learned a few things regarding
his designs.&quot; He waited a moment before uttering his
gravest fear. &quot;Don't give him a chance to strike at
the Prince.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wouldn't dare to do that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He'd dare anything, from what I've heard of him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You hate him because&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go on! Yes, I hate him because he has made <i>her</i>
unhappy. Hello, who's this?&quot;</p>

<p>A man who had ridden up to the gates, his horse covered
with foam, was demanding admission. The
warders halted him unceremoniously as Dangloss rode
forward. They found that he was one of the foremen
in the employ of the railway construction company. He
brought the disquieting news that another strike had
been declared, that the men were ugly and determined to
tear up the track already laid unless their demands were
considered, and, furthermore, that there had been severe
fighting between the two factions engaged on the work.
He urgently implored Dangloss to send troops out to
hold the rioters in check. Many of the men were demanding
their pay so that they might give up their
jobs and return to their own lands.</p>

<p>&quot;What is your name?&quot; demanded the harassed minister
of police.</p>

<p>&quot;Polson,&quot; replied the foreman. He lied, for he was
no other than John Cromer, the unsavoury husband of
Anna Cromer, of the Committee of Ten.</p>

<p>&quot;Come with me,&quot; said Dangloss. &quot;We will go to
General Braze. Good-bye and good luck, Tullis.&quot;</p>

<p>The little baron rode back into the city, accompanied
by the shifty-eyed Cromer, while John Tullis sped off
to the south, riding swiftly by the side of the stern-faced
Captain Haas, an eager company of dragoons behind,
a mountain guide in front.</p>

<p>At that very moment, Loraine Tullis was comparing
notes with Truxton King in the room beneath the
armourer's shop; Count Marlanx was hiding in the
trader's inn outside the northern gates; the abductors
themselves were scattered about the city, laughing triumphantly
over the success of the ruse that had drawn
the well-feared American away on a wild-goose chase
to the distant passes of Dawsbergen. More than that:
at five o'clock in the afternoon a second detachment of
soldiers left the city for the scene of the riots in the
construction camps, twenty miles away.</p>

<p>Surely the well-laid plans of the Iron Count were being
skilfully carried out!</p>

<p>All afternoon and evening men straggled in from the
hills and surrounding country, apparently loth to miss
the early excitement attending the ceremonies on the
following day. Sullen strikers from the camps came
down, cursing the company but drinking noisy toasts
to the railroad and its future. The city by night
swarmed with revelling thousands; the bands were playing,
the crowds were singing, and mobs were drinking
and carousing in the lower end. The cold, drizzling rain
that began to blow across the city at ten o'clock did
little toward checking the hilarity of the revellers.
Honest citizens went to bed early, leaving the streets to
the strangers from the hills and the river-lands. Not
one dreamed of the ugly tragedy that was drawing to
a climax as he slept the sleep of the just, the secure, the
conscience-free.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning word flew from brothel
to brothel, from lodging house to lodging house, in all
parts of the slumbering city; a thousand men crept out
into the streets after the storm, all animated by one impulse,
all obeying a single fierce injunction.</p>

<p>They were to find and kill a tall American! They
were to keep him or his companion from getting in
touch with the police authorities, or with the Royal
Castle, no matter what the cost!</p>

<p>The streets were soon alive with these alert, skulking
minions. Every approach to the points of danger was
guarded by desperate, heavily armed scoundrels who
would not have hesitated an instant if it came to their
hands to kill Truxton King, the man with all their
dearest secrets in his grasp. In dark doorways lounged
these apparently couchless strangers; in areaways and
alleys, on doorsteps they found shelter; in the main
streets and the side streets they roamed. All the time
they had an eager, evil eye out for a tall American and
a slender girl!</p>

<p>Dangloss's lynx-eyed constabulary kept close watch
over these restless, homeless strangers, constantly ordering
them to disperse, or to &quot;move on,&quot; or to &quot;find a bed,
not a doorstep.&quot; The commands were always obeyed;
churlishly, perhaps, in many instances, but never with
physical resistance.</p>

<p>At five o'clock, a stealthy whisper went the rounds,
reaching the ear of every vagabond and cutthroat engaged
in the untiring vigil. Like smoke they faded
away. The silent watch was over.</p>

<p>The word had sped to every corner of the town that
it was no longer necessary to maintain the watch for
Truxton King. He was no longer in a position to give
them trouble or uneasiness!</p>

<p>The twenty-sixth dawned bright and cool after the
savage storm from the north. Brisk breezes floated
down from the mountain peaks; an unreluctant sun
smiled his cheeriest from his seat behind the hills, warmly
awaiting the hour when he could peep above them for
a look into the gala nest of humanity on the western
slope. Everywhere there was activity, life, gladness
and good humour.</p>

<p>Gaudy decorations which had been torn away by the
storm were cheerfully replaced; workmen refurbished
the public stands and the Royal box in the Plaza; bands
paraded the avenues or gave concerts in Regengetz
Circus; troops of mounted soldiers and constabulary
patroled the streets. There was nothing to indicate to
the municipality that the vilest conspiracy of the age&mdash;of
any age&mdash;was gripping its tentacles about the city of
Edelweiss, the smiling, happy city of mountain and
valley. No one could have suspected guile in the laughter
and badinage that masked the manner of the men
who were there to spread disaster in the bunting-clad
thoroughfares.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't like the looks of things,&quot; said Baron Dangloss,
time and again. His men were never so alert as
to-day and never so deceived.</p>

<p>&quot;There can't be trouble of any sort,&quot; mused Colonel
Quinnox. &quot;These fellows are ugly, 'tis true, but they
are not prepared for a demonstration. They are unarmed.
What could they do against the troops, even
though they are considerably depleted?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Colonel, we'll yet see the day when Graustark regrets
the economy that has cut our little army to almost
nothing. What have we now, all told? Three hundred
men in the Royal Guard. Less than six hundred in the
fortress. I have a hundred policemen. There you are.
To-day there are nearly two hundred soldiers off in the
mountains on nasty business of one sort or another.
'Gad, if these ruffians from the railroad possessed no
more than pistols they could give us a merry fight.
There must be a thousand of them. I don't like it.
We'll have trouble before the day's over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;General Braze says his regulars can put down any
sort of an uprising in the city,&quot; protested Quinnox.
&quot;In case of war, you know we have the twenty thousand
reserves, half of whom were regulars until two years
ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perfectly true. Quinnox, it's your duty to take care
of the Prince. You've done so in your family for fifteen
generations. See to it that Prince Robin is well looked
after to-day, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trust me for that, Baron,&quot; said Quinnox with his
truest smile. Even Marlanx knew that he would have
to kill a Quinnox before a Graustark ruler could be
reached.</p>

<p>By eleven o'clock the streets in the neighbourhood of
the Plaza were packed with people. All along Castle
Avenue, up which the Prince was to drive in the coach
of State, hung the proud, adoring burghers and their
families: like geese to flock, like sheep to scatter. At
twelve the Castle gates were to be thrown open for the
brilliant cavalcade that was to pass between these cheering
rows of people. In less than a quarter of an hour
afterward, the Prince and his court, the noble ladies
and gentlemen of Graustark, with the distinguished
visitors from other lands, would pass into the great
square through Regengetz Circus.</p>

<p>At the corner below the crowded Castle Caf&eacute;, in the
north side of the square, which was now patroled by
brilliant dragoons, two men met and exchanged the
compliments of the day. One of them had just come
up on horseback. He dismounted, leaving the animal in
charge of an urchin who saw a gavvo in sight. This
man was young and rather dashing in appearance. The
other was older and plainly a citizen of some consequence.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said the latter impatiently, after they had
passed the time of day for the benefit of the nearest on-lookers.
The younger man, slapping his riding boot
with his crop, led the way to the steps of a house across
the sidewalk. Both had shot a swift, wary glance at
one of the upper windows.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything is ready. There will be no hitch,&quot; said
the horseman in low tones.</p>

<p>&quot;You have seen Spantz?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sh! No names. Yes. The girl is ready.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the fortress?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fifty men are in the houses opposite and others will
go there&mdash;later on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We must keep the reserves out of the fortress. It
would mean destruction if they got to the gun-rooms and
the ammunition houses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is he here?&quot; with a motion toward the upper window.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He came disguised as an old market woman,
just after daybreak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, here's his horse,&quot; said the other, &quot;but he'll have
to change his dress. It isn't a side saddle.&quot; The young
villain laughed silently.</p>

<p>&quot;Go up now to the square, Peter. Your place is
there.&quot;</p>

<p>If one had taken the time to observe, he might have
seen that the young man wore his hat well forward, and
that his face was unnaturally white. We, who suspect
him of being Peter Brutus, have reason to believe that
there was an ugly cut on the top of his head and that
it gave him exceeding pain.</p>

<p>Shortly after half past eleven o'clock certain groups
of men usurped the positions in front of certain buildings
on the south side of the square. A score here, a
half score there, others below them. They favoured the
shops operated by the friends of the Committee of
Ten; they were the men who were to take possession of
the rifles that lay hidden behind counters and walls.
Here, there, everywhere, all about the city, other instructed
men were waiting for the signal that was to
tell them to hustle deadly firearms from the beds of
green-laden market wagons. It was all arranged with
deadly precision. There could be no blunder. The
Iron Count and his deputies had seen to that.</p>

<p>Men were stationed in the proper places to cut all telephone
and telegraph wires leading out of the city.
Others were designated to hold the gates against fugitives
who might seek to reach the troops in the hills.</p>

<p>Marlanx's instructions were plain, unmistakable. Only
soldiers and policemen were to be shot; members of the
royal household were already doomed, including the
ministry and the nobles who rode with the royal carriage.</p>

<p>The Committee of Ten had said that there would not
be another ministry, never another Graustark nobility;
only the Party of Equals. The Iron Count had smiled
to himself and let them believe all that they preached
in secret conclave. But he knew that there would be
another ministry, a new nobility and a new ruler, and
that there would be <i>no Committee of Ten!</i></p>

<p>Two thousand crafty mercenaries, skilled rioters and
fighters from all parts of the world stood ready in the
glad streets of Edelweiss to leap as one man to the
standard of the Iron Count the instant he appeared in
the square after the throwing of the bomb. A well-organised,
carefully instructed army of no mean dimensions,
in the uniform of the lout and vagabond, would
rise like a flash of light before the dazzled, panic-stricken
populace, and Marlanx would be master. Without
the call of drum or bugle his sinister soldiers of
fortune would leap into positions assigned them; in orderly,
determined company front, led by chosen officers,
they would sweep the square, the Circus and the avenues,
up-town to the Castle, down-town to the fortress and
the railway station, everywhere establishing the pennant
of the man who had been banished.</p>

<p>The present dynasty was to end at one o'clock! So
said Marlanx! How could Dangloss or Braze or Quinnox
say him nay? They would be dead or in irons
before the first shock of disaster had ceased to thrill.
The others? Pah! They were as chaff to the Iron
Count.</p>

<p>The calm that precedes the storm fell upon the waiting
throng; an ominous silence spread from one end of the
avenue to the other. For a second only it lasted. The
hush of death could not have been quieter nor more
impressive. Even as people looked at each other in
wonder, the tumult came to its own again. Afterward
a whole populace was to recall this strange, depressing
second of utter stillness; to the end of time that sudden
pall was spoken of with bated breath and in awe.</p>

<p>Then, from the distant Castle came the sound of
shouts, crawling up the long line of spectators for the
full length of the avenue to the eager throng in Regengetz
Circus, swelling and growing louder as the news
came that the Prince had ridden forth from the gates.
Necks were craned, rapt eyes peered down the tree-topped
boulevard, glad voices cried out tidings to those
in the background. The Prince was coming!</p>

<p>Bonny, adorable Prince Robin!</p>

<p>Down the broad avenue came the Royal Military Band,
heading the brilliant procession. Banners were flying;
gold and silver standards gleamed in the van of the
noble cavalcade; brilliantly uniformed cuirassiers and
dragoons on gaily caparisoned horses formed a gilded
phalanx that filled the distant end of the street, slowly
creeping down upon the waiting thousands, drawing
nearer and nearer to the spot of doom.</p>

<p>A stately, noble, inspiring procession it was that swept
toward the Plaza. The love of the people for their
little Prince welled up and overflowed in great waves of
acclamation. Pomp and display, gold and fine raiment
were but the creation of man; Prince Robin was, to them,
the choicest creation of God. He was their Prince!</p>

<p>On came the splendid phalanx of guardsmen, followed
by rigid infantrymen in measured tread; the clattering
of horses' hoofs, the beat of drums, the clanking of
scabbards and the jangling of royal banners, rising
even above the hum of eager voices. The great coach
of gold, with its half score of horses, rolled sombrely beneath
nature's canopy of green, surrounded on all sides
by proud members of the Royal Guard. Word came
down the line that the Prince sat alone in the rear seat of
the great coach, facing the Prime Minister and Countess
Halfont. Two carriages from the royal stables preceded
the Prince's coach. In the first was the Duke of
Perse and three fellow-members of the Cabinet; the
second contained Baron Dangloss and General Braze.
After the Prince came a score or more of rich equipages
filled with the beauty, the nobility, the splendour of this
rich little court.</p>

<p>The curtains in a house at the corner of the square
parted gently. A hawk-faced old man peered out upon
the joyous crowd. His black eyes swept the scene. A
grim smile crept into his face. He dropped the curtains
and walked away from the window, tossing a
cigarette into a grate on the opposite side of the room.
Then he looked at his watch.</p>

<p>All of the bands in the square had ceased playing when
the Castle gates were opened for the royal procession:
only the distant, rythmic beat of a lively march came up
from the avenue to the ears of this baleful old man in
the second-story front room of the home of apothecary
Boltz.</p>

<p>At the extreme outer side of Regengetz Circus a small
group of men and women stood, white-faced and immovable,
steadfastly holding a position in the front
rank of spectators. Shrinking back among this determined
coterie was the slender, shuddering figure of
Olga Platanova, haggard-faced, but with the light of
desperation in her eyes.</p>

<p>As the procession drew nearer, the companions of this
wretched girl slunk away from her side, losing themselves
in the crowd, leaving her to do her work while they
sought distant spots of safety. Olga Platanova, her
arms folded beneath the long red cloak she wore, remained
where they had placed her and&mdash;waited!</p>

<h3>THE MERRY VAGABOND</h3>


<p>The man who stood in the middle of the freight-car,
looking down in wonder at the fugitives, was a tall
vagabond of the most picturesque type. No ragamuffin
was ever so tattered and torn as this rakish individual.
His clothes barely hung together on his lank frame; he
was barefoot and hatless; a great mop of black hair
topped his shrewd, rugged face; coal-black eyes snapped
and twinkled beneath shaggy brows and a delighted,
knowing grin spread slowly over his rather boyish countenance.
He was not a creature to strike terror to the
heart of any one; on the contrary, his mischievous,
sprightly face produced an impression of genuine good
humour and absolute indifference to the harsh things
of life.</p>

<p>Long, thin lips curled into a smile of delicious regard;
his sides shook with the quiet chuckle of understanding.
He did not lose his smile, even when the match burned
his finger tips and fell to the floor of the car. Instead,
the grin was broader when he struck the second match
and resumed his amused scrutiny of his fellow-lodgers.
This time he practised thrift: he lighted a cigarette
with the match before tossing it aside. Then he softly
slid the car door back in its groove and looked out into
the moist, impenetrable night. A deep sigh left his
smiling lips; a retrospective langour took possession
of his long frame; he sighed again, and still he smiled.</p>

<p>Leaning against the side of the door this genial gypsy
smoked in blissful silence until the stub grew so short
that it burned his already singed fingers. He was thinking
of other days and nights, and of many maids in far-off
lands, and of countless journeys in which he, too,
had had fair and gentle company&mdash;short journeys, yes,
but not to be forgotten. Ah, to be knight of the road
and everlasting squire to the Goddess of Love! He
always had been that&mdash;ever since he could remember;
he had loved a hundred briefly; none over long. It was
the only way.</p>

<p>Once more he turned to look upon the sleeping pair.
This time he lighted the stub of a tallow candle. The
tender, winning smile in his dark eyes grew to positive
radiance. Ah, how he envied this great, sleeping wayfarer!
How beautiful his mistress! How fortunate the
lover! And how they slept&mdash;how tired they were!
Whence had they come? From what distant land had
they travelled together to reach this holiday-garnished
city in the hills? Vagabonds, tramps! They were of
his world, a part of his family; he knew and had loved
a hundred of her sisters, he was one of a hundred-thousand
brothers to this man.</p>

<p>Why should he stay here to spoil their waking hour?
The thought came to him suddenly. No; he would
surrender his apartment to them. He was free and
foot-loose; he could go elsewhere. He <i>would</i> go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Softly he tip-toed to his own corner of the car, looking
over his shoulder with anxious eyes to see that his movements
did not disturb them. He gathered up his belongings:
an ancient violin case, a stout walking stick,
a goodly sized pack done up in gaudy cloth, a well-worn
pair of sandals with long, frayed lacings. As
gently he stole back to the door. Here he sat down,
with his feet hanging outside the car. Then, with many
a sly, wary glance at his good comrades, he put on his
sandals and laced them up the leg. He tossed a kiss to
the sleeping girl, his dark gypsy face aglow with admiration
and mischief, and was about to blow out the
light of his candle. Then he changed his mind. He
arose and stood over them again, looking long and
solemnly at the face of the sleeping girl. Ah, yes, she
was the most beautiful he had ever seen&mdash;the very
fairest. He had known her sisters, but-no, they were
not like this one. With a sly grimace of envy he shook
his fist at the tall man whose leg served as a pillow for
the tired head.</p>

<p>The girl looked wan and tired&mdash;and hungry. Poor
thing! Never had he seen one so sweet and lovely as
she; never had he seen such a shockingly muddy mackintosh,
however, as the one she wore, never were hands so
dirty as the slender ones which lay limp before her.
With a determined shake of his head and a new flash of
the eye he calmly seated himself and began to open his
ragged pack. Once he paused, a startled look in his
face. He caught sight of the revolver at Truxton's side
for the first time. The instant of alarm passed and a
braver smile than ever came. Ah, here was a knight
who would fight for his lady love! Good fellow! Bravo!</p>

<p>At last his small store of food lay exposed. Without
hesitation he divided the pieces of smoked venison, giving
one part to himself, two to the sleepers; then the
miller's bread and the cheese, and the bag of dates he
had bought the day before. He tied up his own slender
portion and would have whistled for the joy of it all
had he not bethought himself in time.</p>

<p>From one of his pockets he drew out tobacco and
cigarette papers. With his back planted up against
the wall of the car, his legs crossed and his feet wiggling
time to the inward tune he sang, he calmly rolled half
a dozen cigarettes and placed them, one by one, beside
the feast. One match from his thin supply he placed
alongside the cigarettes. Then he looked very doubtful.
No; one might blow out. He must not be niggardly.
So he kept two for himself and gave three to
the guest at his banquet.</p>

<p>Again he blew a kiss to the prettiest girl he had ever
seen. Snuffing his candle, he dropped to the ground and
closed the door against all spying, uncivil eyes.</p>

<p>The first grey of dawn was growing in the sombre east.
He looked out over the tops of cars and sniffed the air.
The rain was over. He knew. A tinge of red that none
but the gypsy could have distinguished betrayed the approach
of a sunny day. Jauntily he swung off down
the path between the lines of cars, his fickle mind wavering
between the joys of the coming day and the memory
of the loveliest Romany he had ever encountered.</p>

<p>Daybreak found him at the wharf gates. It was
gloomy here and silent; the city above looked asleep and
unfruitful. His heart was gay; he longed for company.
Whimsical, careless hearted, he always obeyed the impulse
that struck him first. As he stood there, surveying
the wet, deserted wharf, it came to him suddenly that
if he went back and played one soft love-song before the
door of the car, they might invite him to join them in
the breakfast that the genie had brought.</p>

<p>His long legs were swift. In five minutes he was half
way down the line of cars, at the extreme end of which
stood the happy lodging place of his heart's desire.
Then he paused, a dubious frown between his eyes. No!
he said, slapping his own cheek soundly; it would not
be fair! He would not disturb them, not he! How
could he have thought of such a thing. <i>Le bon Dieu!</i>
Never! He would breakfast alone!</p>

<p>Coming to an empty flat car, direct from the quarries,
he resolutely seated himself upon its edge, and, with
amiable resignation, set about devouring his early meal,
all the while casting longing, almost appealing glances
toward the next car but one. Busy little switch engines
began chugging about the yards; the railroad, at least,
was exhibiting some signs of life. Here and there the
crews were &quot;snaking&quot; out sections and bumping them
off to other parts of the gridiron; a car here, a car there&mdash;all
aflounder, but quite simple to this merry wanderer.
He knew all about switching, he did. It did not
cause him the least uneasiness when a sudden jar told
him that an engine had been attached to the distant end
of the string in which he breakfasted. Nor was he
disturbed when the cars began to move. What cared he?
He would ride in his dining-car to the objective switch,
wherever that was, and no doubt would find himself
nearer the main freight depot, with little or no walking
to do on his journey to the square.</p>

<p>But the &quot;string&quot; was not bound for another track in
the yards; it was on its way to the main line, thence off
through the winding valley into strange and distant
lands.</p>

<p>Sir Vagabond, blissfully swinging his heels and munching
his venison, smiled amiably upon the yard men as he
passed them by. So genial was the smile, so frank the
salutation, that not one scowled back at him or hurled
the chunk of coal that bespeaks a surly temper. Down
through the maze of sidetracks whisked the little train,
out upon the main line with a thin shriek of greeting,
past the freight houses&mdash;it was then that Sir Vagabond
sat up very straight, a look of mild interest in his
eyes. Interest gave way to perplexity, perplexity to
concern. What's this? Leaving the city? He wasted
no time. This would never do! Clutching his belongings
to his side, he vaulted from one hand, nimbly and
with the gracefulness of wide experience, landing safely
on his feet at the roadside.</p>

<p>There he stood with the wry, dazed look of a man who
suddenly finds himself guilty of arrant stupidity, watching
the cars whiz past on their way to the open country.
Just ahead was the breach in the wall through which all
trains entered or left the city. Into that breach shot
the train, going faster and faster as it saw the straight,
clear track beyond. He waited until the tail end
whisked itself out of sight in the cut below the city walls,
and then trudged slowly, dejectedly in the opposite direction,
his heart in his boots. He was thinking of the
luckless pair in the empty &quot;box.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped, his chin up, his hands to his
sides. A hearty peal of laughter soared from his lips.
He was regarding the funny side of the situation. The
joke was on them! It was rich! The more he thought
of their astonishment on awaking, the more he laughed.
He leaned against a car.</p>

<p>His immense levity attracted attention. Four or five
men approached him from the shadows of the freight
houses, ugly, unsmiling fellows. They demanded of him
the cause of his unseemly mirth. With tears in his
merry black eyes he related the plight of the pretty
slumberers, dwelling more or less sentimentally on the
tender beauty of the maiden fair. They plied him with
questions. He described the couple&mdash;even glowingly.
Then the sinister fellows smiled; more than that, they
clapped each other on the back and swore splendidly.
He was amazed and his own good humour gave way to
fierce resentment. What right had these ruffians to
laugh at the misfortunes of that unhappy maid?</p>

<p>A switchman came up, and one of the men, a lank
American whom we should recognise by the sound of
his voice (having heard it before), asked whither the
train was bound and when it would first stop in its
flight.</p>

<p>&quot;At the Poo quarries, seventeen kilometers down the
line. They cut out a few empties there. She goes on
to the division point after that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Any trains up from that direction this morning?&quot;
demanded &quot;Newport.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not till this afternoon. Most of the crews are in the
city for the&mdash;&quot; But the switchman had no listeners
beyond that statement.</p>

<p>And so it was that the news spread over town at five
o'clock that Truxton King was where he could do no
harm. It was well known that the train would make
forty miles an hour down the steep grade into the lower
valley.</p>

<p>Up into the city strolled Sir Vagabond, his fiddle in
his hand, his heart again as light as a feather. Some
day&mdash;ah, some day! he would see her again on the road.
It was always the way. Then he would tell her how
unhappy he had been&mdash;for a minute. She was so pretty,
so very pretty! He sighed profoundly. We see no
more of him.</p>

<p>When Truxton King first awoke to the fact that they
were no longer lying motionless in the dreary yards,
he leaped to his feet with a startled shout of alarm.
Loraine sat up, blinking her eyes in half-conscious wonder.
It was broad daylight, of course; the train was
rattling through the long cut just below the city walls.
With frantic energy he pulled open the door. For a
minute he stared at the scudding walls of stone so close
at hand, uncomprehendingly. Then the truth burst
upon him with the force of a mighty blow. He staggered
back, his jaw dropping, his eyes glaring.</p>

<p>&quot;What the dev&mdash;Great God, Loraine! We're going!
We're moving!&quot; he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>&quot;I know it,&quot; she gasped, her body rocking violently
with the swaying of the wild, top-heavy little car.</p>

<p>&quot;Great Scott! How we're pounding it! Fifty miles
an hour. Where are we?&quot; he cried, aghast. He could
scarcely keep his feet, so terrific was the speed and so
sickening the motion.</p>

<p>She got to her feet and lurched to his side. &quot;Don't fall
out!&quot; she almost shrieked. He drew back with her. Together
they swayed like reeds in a windstorm, staring
dizzily at the wall before them.</p>

<p>Suddenly the train shot out into the open, farm-spattered valley.
Truxton fell back dumbfounded.</p>

<p>&quot;The country!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;We've been carried
away. I&mdash;I can't believe my senses. Could we have
slept&mdash;what a fool, what an idiot! God in heaven! The
Prince! He is lost!&quot; He was beside himself with
anguish and despair, raging like a madman, cursing
himself for a fool, a dog, a murderer!</p>

<p>Little less distressed than her companion, Loraine Tullis
still had the good sense to keep him from leaping from
the car. He had shouted to her that he must get back to
the city; she could go on to the next town and find a
hiding place. He would come to her as soon as he had
given the alarm.</p>

<p>&quot;You would be killed,&quot; she cried, clutching his arm
fiercely. &quot;You never can jump, Truxton. See how we
are running. If you jump, I shall follow. I won't go
on alone. I am as much to blame as you.&quot;</p>

<p>The big, strong fellow broke down and cried, utterly
disheartened.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't cry, Truxton, please don't cry!&quot; she pleaded.
&quot;Something will happen. We must stop sometime.
Then we can get another train back, or telegraph, or
hire a wagon. It must be very early. The sun is
scarcely up. Do be brave! Don't give up!&quot;</p>

<p>He squared his shoulders. &quot;You put me to shame!&quot; he
cried abjectly. &quot;I'm&mdash;I'm unnerved, that's all. It was
too much of a blow. After we'd got away from those
scoundrels so neatly, too. Oh, it's maddening! I'll be
all right in a minute. You plucky, plucky darling!&quot;</p>

<p>The train whirled through a small hamlet without even
slackening its speed. Truxton endeavoured to shout a
warning to two men who stood by the gates; but they
merely laughed, not comprehending. Then he undertook
to arrest the attention of the engineer. He leaned
from the door and shouted. The effort was futile, almost
disastrous. A lurch came near to hurling him to
the rocky road bed. Now and then they passed farmers
on the high road far above, bound for the city. They
called out to them, but the cries were in vain. With every
minute they were running farther and farther away
from the city of Edelweiss; every mile was adding to the
certainty of the doom which hung over the little Prince
and his people.</p>

<p>A second small station flew by. &quot;Ronn: seven kilometers
to Edelweiss.&quot; He looked at her in despair.</p>

<p>&quot;We're going faster and faster,&quot; he grated. &quot;This is
the fastest train in the world, Loraine, bar none.&quot;</p>

<p>Just then his gaze alighted on the pathetic breakfast
and the wandering cigarettes. He stared as if hypnotised.
Was he going mad? An instant later he was on
his hands and knees, examining the mysterious feast.
She joined him at once; no two faces ever before were
so puzzled and perplexed.</p>

<p>&quot;By heaven!&quot; he exclaimed, drawing her away from
the spot in quick alarm, comprehension flooding his
brain. &quot;I see it all! We've been deliberately shanghaied!
We've been bottled up here, drugged, perhaps,
and shipped out of town by fast freight&mdash;no destination.
Don't touch that stuff! It's probably full of poison.
Great Scott! What a clever gang they are! And what
a blithering idiot they have in me to deal with. Oh,
how easy!&quot;</p>

<p>Whereupon he proceeded to kick the unoffending
breakfast, cigarettes and all, out of the car door. To
their dying day they were to believe that the food had
been put there by agents of the great conspirator. It
readily may be surmised that neither of them was given
to sensible deductions during their astounding flight.
If they had thought twice, they might have seen the
folly of their quick conclusions. Marlanx's men would
not have sent Loraine off in a manner like this. But the
distracted pair were not in an analytical frame of mind
just then; that is why the gentle munificence of Sir
Vagabond came to a barren waste.</p>

<p>Mile after mile flew by. The unwilling travellers, depressed
beyond description, had given up all hope of
leaving the car until it reached the point intended by
the wily plotters. To their amazement, however, the
speed began to slacken perceptibly after they had left
the city ten or twelve miles behind. Truxton was leaning
against the side of the door, gloomily surveying the
bright, green landscape. For some time Loraine had
been steadying herself by clinging to his arm. They had
cast off the unsightly rain coats and other clumsy articles.
Once, through sheer inability to control his impulses,
he had placed his arm about her slim waist, but
she had gently freed herself. Her look of reproach
was sufficient to check all future impulses of a like
nature.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; said he, coming out of his bitter dream.</p>

<p>&quot;We're slowing up.&quot; He looked out and ahead. &quot;No
station is in sight. There's a bridge down the road a
bit&mdash;yes, there's our same old river. By George!&quot; His
face was a study.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she cried, struck by his sudden energy
of speech.</p>

<p>&quot;They're running slow for the bridge. Afraid of the
floods. D'ye see? If they creep up to it as they do
in the United States when they're cautious, we'll politely
drop off and&mdash;'Pon my soul, she's coming down to a
snail's pace. We can swing off, Loraine. Now's our
chance!&quot;</p>

<p>The train was barely creeping up to the bridge. He
clasped her in the strong crook of his left arm, slid
down to a sitting position, and boldly pushed himself
clear of the car, landing on his feet. Staggering forward
with the impetus he had received, he would have
fallen except for a mighty effort. A sharp groan
escaped his lips as he lowered her to the ground. She
looked anxiously into his face and saw nothing there
but relief.</p>

<p>The cars rumbled across the bridge, picked up speed
beyond, and thundered off in the distance with never so
much as a thought of the two who stood beside the
track and laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>&quot;Come along,&quot; said the man briefly. &quot;We must try
to reach that station back there. There I can telegraph
in. Oh!&quot; His first attempt to walk brought out a
groan of pain.</p>

<p>He had turned his ankle in the leap to the ground. She
was deeply concerned, but he sought to laugh it off.
Gritting his teeth determinedly, he led the way back
along the track.</p>

<p>&quot;Lean on me,&quot; she cried despairingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; he said with grim stubbornness. &quot;I don't
mind the pain. We can't stop for a sprained ankle.
It's an old one I got playing football. We may have to
go a little slow, but we'll not stop, my dear&mdash;not till
we get word to Dangloss!&quot;</p>

<p>She found a long, heavy stick for him; thereafter he
hobbled with greater speed and less pain. At a wagon-road
crossing they paused to rest, having covered two
miles. The strain was telling on him; perspiration stood
out in great drops upon his brow; he was beginning to
despair. Her little cry of joy caused him to look up
from the swollen ankle which he was regarding with
dubious concern. An oxcart was approaching from the
west.</p>

<p>&quot;A ride!&quot; she cried joyously. She had been ready to
drop with fatigue; her knees were shaking. His first
exclamation of joy died away in a groan of dismay. He
laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&quot;That thing couldn't get us anywhere in a week,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p>&quot;But it will help,&quot; she cried brightly, an optimist by
force of necessity.</p>

<p>They stopped the cart and bargained for a ride to
Ronn. The man was a farmer, slow and suspicious.
He haggled.</p>

<p>&quot;The country's full of evil men and women these days,&quot;
he demurred. &quot;Besides I have a heavy enough load as
it is for my poor beasts.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Tullis conducted the negotiations, making the
best of her year's acquaintance with the language of the
country.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't tell him why we are in such a hurry,&quot; cautioned
King. &quot;He may be a Marlanx sympathiser.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have nothing in your cart but melons,&quot; she said
to the farmer, peeping under the corner of the canvas
covering.</p>

<p>&quot;I am not going through Ronn, but by the high road
to Edelweiss,&quot; he protested. &quot;A good ten kilometers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But carry us until we come up with some one who can
give us horses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Horses!&quot; he croaked. &quot;Every horse in the valley is
in Edelweiss by this time. This is the great day there.
The statue of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, yes, I know. We are bound for Edelweiss. Can
you get us there in two hours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With these beasts, poor things? Never!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It will be worth your while. A hundred gavvos if
you carry us to a place where we can secure quicker
transportation.&quot;</p>

<p>In time she won him over. He agreed to carry them
along the way, at his best speed, until they came up with
better beasts or reached the city gates. It was the best
he could do. The country was practically deserted on
this day. At best there were but few horses in the
valley; mostly oxen. They climbed up to the seat and
the tortuous journey began. The farmer trotted beside
the wheel nearly all of the way, descanting warmly
in painful English on the present condition of things in
the hills.</p>

<p>&quot;The rascals have made way with the beautiful Miss
Tullis. She is the American lady stopping at the
Castle. You should see her, sir. Excepting our dear
Princess Yetive&mdash;God rest her soul&mdash;she is the most
beautiful creature Graustark has ever seen. I have seen
her often. Not quite so grand as the Countess Ingomede,
but fairer, believe me. She is beloved by everyone.
Many a kind and generous word has she spoken to me.
My onion beds are well known to her. She has come to
my farm time and again, sir, with the noble personages,
while riding, and she has in secret bought my little slips
of onions. She has said to me that she adores them,
but that she can only eat them in secret. Ah, sir, it
is a sad day for Graustark that evil has happened to her.
Her brother, they say, is off in the Dawsbergen hills
searching for her. He is a grand man.&quot;</p>

<p>His passengers were duly interested. She nudged the
lugubrious Truxton when the man spoke of the onions.
&quot;What a fibber! I hate onions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is to be married to the Count Vos Engo; a fine
lad, sir. Now she is gone, I don't know what he will
do. Suicide, mayhap. Many is the time I have cautioned
her not to ride in the hills without a strong
guard. These bandits are getting very bold.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know the great Count Marlanx?&quot; demanded
King, possessed of a sudden thought. The man faced
him at the mention of the name, a suspicious gleam in
his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Count Marlanx!&quot; he snorted. Without another word,
he drew the beasts to a standstill. There was no mistaking
the angry scowl. &quot;Are you friends of that
snake? If you are, get out of my cart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's all right,&quot; cried Truxton. &quot;Tell him who we
are, Loraine, and why we <i>must</i> get to the city.&quot;</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the farmer, overcome by the stupendous
news, was lashing his oxen with might and main;
the astonished beasts tore down the road to Ronn so
bravely that there seemed some prospect of getting a
telegram through in time. All the way the excited
countryman groaned and swore and sputtered his prayers.
At Ronn they learned that the operator had been
unable to call Edelweiss since seven o'clock. The wires
were down or had been cut. Truxton left a message
to be sent to Dangloss in case he could get the wire, and
off they started again for the city gates, having lost
considerable time by the diverted mile or two.</p>

<p>Not man, woman or child did they encounter as the
miles crept by. The country was barren of humanity.
Ahead of them was the ascent to be conquered by oxen
so old and feeble that the prospect was more than
dubious.</p>

<p>&quot;If it should be that my team gives out, I will run on
myself to give the alarm,&quot; cried the worthy, perspiring
charioteer. &quot;It shall not be! God preserve us!&quot;</p>

<p>Three times the oxen broke down, panting and stubborn;
as many times he thwacked them and kicked them
and cursed them into action again. They stumbled
pitifully, but they <i>did</i> manage to go forward.</p>

<p>In time the city gates came in sight&mdash;far up the
straight, narrow road. &quot;Pray God we may not be too
late,&quot; groaned the farmer. &quot;Damn the swine who took
their horses to town before the sun was up. Curse
them for fools and imbeciles. Fools never get into
heaven. Thank the good Lord for that.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed to the quivering Americans that the gates
were mocking them by drawing farther away instead of
coming nearer.</p>

<p>&quot;Are we going backward?&quot; groaned Truxton, his
hands gripping the side of the bounding seat.</p>

<p>Near the gates, which were still open, it occurred to
him in a single flash of dismay that he and Loraine
would be recognised and intercepted by Marlanx watchers.
Between the fierce jolts of the great cart he
managed to convey his fears to her.</p>

<p>It was she who had the solution. They might succeed
in passing the gates if they hid themselves in the bed of
the cart, underneath the thick canvas covering. The
farmer lifted the cloth and they crawled down among
the melons. In this fashion they not only covered the
remainder of the distance, half stifled by the heat and
half murdered by the uncomfortable position, but passed
through the gates and were taken clattering down the
streets toward the centre of town.</p>

<p>&quot;To the Tower!&quot; cried the anxious Truxton.</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible!&quot; shouted the farmer. &quot;The streets are
roped off and the crowds are too great.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let us out as near to the Tower as possible,
cried the other.</p>

<p>&quot;Here we are,&quot; cried the driver, a few minutes later,
pulling up his half dead oxen and leaping to the ground.
He threw off the covering and they lost no time in tumbling
from their bed of melons to the cobble-stone pavement
of a narrow alley into which he had turned for
safety. &quot;Through this passage!&quot; he gasped, hoarse
with excitement. &quot;The Tower is below. Follow me!
My oxen will stand. I am going with you!&quot; His
rugged face was aglow.</p>

<p>Off through the alley they hurried, King disdaining
the pain his ankle was giving him. They came to the
crowded square a few minutes later. The clock in the
Cathedral pointed to twelve o'clock and after! The
catastrophe had not yet taken place; the people were
laughing and singing and shouting. They were in time.
Everywhere they heard glad voices crying out that the
Prince was coming! It was the Royal band that they
heard through dinning ears!</p>

<p>&quot;Great God!&quot; cried Truxton, stopping suddenly and
pointing with trembling hand to a spot across the street
and a little below where they had pushed through the
resentful, staring throng on the sidewalk. &quot;There she
is! At the corner! Stop her!&quot;</p>

<p>He had caught sight of Olga Platanova.</p>

<p>The first row of dragoons was already passing in front
of her. Less than two hundred feet away rolled the
royal coach of gold! All this flashed before the eyes of
the distracted pair, who were now dashing frantically
into the open street, disregarding the shouts of the
police and the howls of the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;An anarchist!&quot; shouted King hoarsely. He looked
like one himself. &quot;The bomb! The bomb! Stop the
Prince!&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Quinnox recognised this bearded, uncouth
figure, and the flying, terrified girl at his heels. King
was dragging her along by the hand. There was an
instant of confusion on the part of the vanguard, a
drawing of sabres, a movement toward the coach in
which the Prince rode.</p>

<p>Quinnox alone prevented the dragoons from cutting
down the pallid madman who stumbled blindly toward
the coaches beyond. He whirled his steed after an
astonished glance in all directions, shouting eager commands
all the while. When he reached the side of the
gasping American, that person had stopped and was
pointing toward the trembling Olga, who had seen and
recognised him.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop the coach!&quot; cried King. Loraine was running
frantically through the ranks of horsemen, screaming
her words of alarm.</p>

<p>The Duke of Perse leaped from his carriage and ran
forward, shouting to the soldiers to seize the disturbers.
Panic seized the crowd. There was a mad rush for the
corner above. Olga Platanova stood alone, her eyes
wide and glassy, staring as if petrified at the face of
Truxton King.</p>

<p>He saw the object in her wavering hand. With a
yell he dashed for safety down the seething avenue. The
Duke of Perse struck at him as he passed, ignoring the
frantic cry of warning that he uttered. A plain, white-faced
farmer in a smock of blue was crossing the street
with mighty bounds, his eyes glued upon the arm of the
frail, terrified anarchist. If he could only arrest that
palsied, uncertain arm!</p>

<p>But she hurled the bomb, her hands going to her eyes
as she fell upon her knees.</p>

<h3>THE THROWING OF THE BOMB</h3>


<p>The scene that followed beggars all powers of description.</p>

<p>A score of men and horses lay writhing in the street;
others crept away screaming with pain; human flesh and
that of animals lay in the path of the frenzied, panic-stricken
holiday crowd; blood mingled with the soft mud
of Regengetz Circus, slimy, slippery, ugly!</p>

<p>Rent bodies of men in once gaudy uniforms, now
flattened and bruised in warm, oozy death, were piled in
a mass where but a moment before the wondering vanguard
of troopers had clustered. For many rods in all
directions stunned creatures were struggling to their
feet after the stupendous shock that had felled them.
The clattering of frightened horses, the shouts and
screams of men and women, the gruesome rush of ten
thousand people in stampede&mdash;all in twenty seconds after
the engine of death left the hand of Olga Platanova.</p>

<p>Olga Platanova! There was nothing left of her! She
had failed to do the deed expected of her, but she would
not hear the execrations of those who had depended upon
her to kill the Prince. We draw a veil across the picture
of Olga Platanova after the bomb left her hand;
no one may look upon the quivering, shattered thing
that once was a living, beautiful woman. The glimpse
she had of Truxton King's haggard face unnerved her.
She faltered, her strength of will collapsed; she hurled
the bomb in a panic of indecision. Massacre but not
conquest!</p>

<p>Down in an alley below the Tower, a trembling, worn
team of oxen stood for a day and night, awaiting the
return of a master who was never to come back to them.
God rest his simple soul!</p>

<p>Truxton King picked himself up from the street,
dazed, bewildered but unhurt. Everywhere about him
mad people were rushing and screeching. Scarcely
knowing what he did, he fled with the crowd. From behind
him came the banging of guns, followed by new
shouts of terror. He knew what it meant! The revolutionists
had begun the assault on the paralysed
minions of the government.</p>

<p>Scores of Royal Guardsmen swept past him, rushing
to the support of the coach of gold. The sharp, shrill
scream of a single name rose above the tumult. Some
one had seen the Iron Count!</p>

<p>&quot;Marlanx!&quot;</p>

<p>He looked back toward the gory entrance to the Circus.
There was Marlanx, mounted and swinging a sabre on
high. Ahead was the mass of carriages, filled with the
white-faced, palsied prey from the Court of Graustark.
Somewhere in that huddled, glittering crowd were two
beings he willingly would give his own life to save.</p>

<p>Foot soldiers, policemen and mounted guardsmen began
firing into the crowd at the square, without sense or
discretion, falling back, nevertheless, before the well-timed,
deliberate advance of the mercenaries. From
somewhere near the spot where Olga Platanova fell came
a harsh, penetrating command:</p>

<p>&quot;Cut them off! Cut them off from the Castle!&quot;</p>

<p>It was his cue. He dashed into the street and ran toward
the carriages, shouting with all his strength:</p>

<p>&quot;Turn back! It is Marlanx! To the Castle!&quot;</p>

<p>Then it was that he saw the Prince. The boy was
standing on a seat on the royal coach of state, holding
out his eager little hands to some one in the thick of the
crowd that surged about him. He was calling some
one's name, but no one could have heard him.</p>

<p>Truxton's straining eyes caught sight of the figure in
grey that struggled forward in response to the cries
and the extended hands. He pushed his way savagely
through the crowd; he came up with her as she reached
the side of the coach, and with a shout of encouragement
grasped her in his arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Loraine! Aunt Loraine!&quot; He now heard the
name the boy cried with all his little heart.</p>

<p>Two officers struck at the uncouth, desperate American
as he lifted the girl from the ground and deliberately
tossed her into the coach.</p>

<p>&quot;Turn back!&quot; he shouted. A horseman rode him down.
He looked up as the plunging animal's hoofs clattered
about his head. Vos Engo, with drawn sword, was
crowding up to the carriage door, shouting words of
rejoicing at sight of the girl he loved.</p>

<p>Somehow he managed to crawl from under the hoofs
and wheels, not without thumps and bruises, and made
his way to the sidewalk. The coach had swung around
and the horses were being lashed into a gallop for the
Castle gates.</p>

<p>He caught a glimpse of her, holding the Prince in her
arms, her white, agonised face turned toward the mob.
Distinctly he heard her cry:</p>

<p>&quot;Save him! Save Truxton King!&quot;</p>

<p>From the sidewalks swarmed well-armed hordes of
desperadoes, firing wildly into the ranks of devoted
guardsmen grouped in the avenue to cover the flight of
their royal charge. Truxton fled from the danger zone
as fast as his legs would carry him. Bullets were striking
all about him. Later on he was to remember his
swollen, bitterly painful ankle; but there was no thought
of it now. He had played football with this same ankle
in worse condition than it was now&mdash;and he had played
for the fun of it, too.</p>

<p>He realised that his life was worth absolutely nothing
if he fell into the hands of the enemy. His only chance
lay in falling in with some sane, loyal citizen who could
be prevailed upon to hide him until the worst was over.
There seemed no possibility of getting inside the Castle
grounds. He had done his duty and&mdash;he laughed
bitterly as he thought of it&mdash;he had been ridden down
by the men he came to save.</p>

<p>Some one was shouting his name behind in the scurrying
crowd. He turned for a single glance backward.
Little Mr. Hobbs, pale as a ghost, his cap gone, his
clothing torn, was panting at his elbow.</p>

<p>&quot;God save us!&quot; gasped Hobbs. &quot;Are you alive or am
I seeing all the bloody ghosts in the world?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm alive all right,&quot; cried King. &quot;Where can we go?
Be quick, Hobbs! Think! Don't sputter like that. I
want to be personally conducted, and damned quick at
that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before God, sir, I 'aven't the idea where to go,&quot;
groaned Hobbs. &quot;It's dreadful! Did you see what the
woman did back there&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't stop to tell me about it, Hobbs. Keep on running.
Go ahead of me. I'm used to following the man
from Cook's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right you are, sir. I say, by Jove, I'm glad to see
you&mdash;I am. You came right up out of the ground as
if&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there no way to get off this beastly avenue?&quot;
panted King. &quot;They're shooting back there like a pack
of wild men. I hate to think of what's going on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dangloss will 'ave them all in the jug inside of ten
minutes, take my word&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'll have Dangloss hanging from a telephone;
pole, Hobbs! Don't talk! Run!&quot;</p>

<p>Soldiers came riding up from behind, turning to fire
from their saddles into the throng of cutthroats, led
by the grim old man with the bloody sabre. In the
centre of the troop there was a flying carriage. The
Duke of Perse was lying back in the seat, his face like
that of a dead man. Far ahead rattled the royal coach
and the wildly flying carriages of state.</p>

<p>&quot;The Prince is safe!&quot; shouted King joyously. &quot;They'll
make it! Thank God!&quot;</p>

<p>Colonel Quinnox turned in his saddle and searched out
the owner of that stirring voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Come!&quot; he called, drawing rein as soon as he caught
sight of him.</p>

<p>Even as King rushed out into the roadway a horseman
galloped up from the direction of the Castle. He pulled
his horse to his haunches almost as he was riding over the
dodging American.</p>

<p>&quot;Here!&quot; shouted the newcomer, scowling down upon
the young man. &quot;Swing up here! Quick, you fool!&quot;</p>

<p>It was Vos Engo, his face black with fury. Quinnox
had seized the hand of Mr. Hobbs on seeing help for
King and was pulling him up before him. There was
nothing for Truxton to do but to accept the timely
help of his rival. An instant later he was up behind him
and they were off after the last of the dragoons.</p>

<p>&quot;If you don't mind, Count, I'll try my luck,&quot; grated
the American. Holding on with one arm, he turned and
fired repeatedly in the direction of the howling crowd
of rascals.</p>

<p>&quot;Ride to the barracks gates, Vos Engo!&quot; commanded
Colonel Quinnox. &quot;Be prepared to admit none but the
Royal Reserves, who are under standing orders to report
there in time of need.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God grant that they may be able to come,&quot; responded
the Count. Over his shoulder he hissed to his companion.
&quot;It was not idle heroics, my friend, nor philanthropy
on my part. I was commanded to come and fetch
you. She would never have spoken to me again if I had
refused.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She? Ah, yes; I see. Good! She did not forget
me!&quot; cried Truxton, his heart bounding.</p>

<p>&quot;My own happiness depends on my luck in getting you
to safety,&quot; rasped the Count. &quot;My life's happiness.
Understand, damn you, it is not for you that I risk my
life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; murmured Truxton, a wry smile on
his pale lips. &quot;You mean, she is going to pay you in
some way for picking me up, eh? Well, I'll put an
end to that. I'll drop off again. Then you can ride on
and tell her&mdash;I wouldn't be a party to the game. Do you
catch my meaning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You would, eh?&quot; said the Count angrily. &quot;I'd like
to see you drop off while we're going at this&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've got my pistol in the middle of your back,&quot; grated
Truxton. &quot;Slow up a bit or I'll scatter your vertebr&aelig;
all over your system. Pull up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you like,&quot; cried Vos Engo. &quot;I've done my part.
Colonel Quinnox will bear witness.&quot; He began pulling
his horse down. &quot;Now, you are quite free to drop off.&quot;</p>

<p>Without a word the American swung his leg over and
slid to the ground. &quot;Thanks for the lift you've given
me,&quot; he called up to the astonished officer.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't thank me,&quot; sang out his would-be saviour as
he put spur to his horse.</p>

<p>It is a lamentable thing to say, but Truxton King's
extraordinary sacrifice was not altogether the outgrowth
of heroism. We have not been called upon at
any time to question his courage; we have, on the other
hand, seen times when he displayed the most arrant foolhardiness.
I defy any one to prove, however, that he
ever neglected an opportunity to better himself by
strategy at the expense of fortitude. Therefore, it is
not surprising that even at such a time as this we may
be called upon to record an example of his spectacular
cunning.</p>

<p>Be sure of it, he did not decide to slide from Vos Engo's
horse until he saw a way clear to better his position,
and at the same time to lessen the glory of his unpleasant
rescuer.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards behind loped a riderless
horse; the dragoon who had sat the saddle was lying
far back in the avenue, a bullet in his head. Hobbling
to the middle of the road, the American threw up his
hands and shouted briskly to the bewildered animal.
Throwing his ears forward in considerable doubt, the
horse came to a standstill close at hand. Five seconds
later King was in the saddle and tearing along in the
wake of the retreating guard, his hair blowing from
his forehead, his blood leaping with the joy of achievement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs afterward informed him that Count Vos
Engo's oaths were worth going miles to avoid.</p>

<p>&quot;We need such men as King!&quot; cried Colonel Quinnox
as he waited inside the gates for the wild rider. A moment
later King dashed through and the massive bolts
were shot.</p>

<p>As he pulled up in front of the steward's lodge to
await the orders of the Colonel, the exultant American
completed the soliloquy that began with the mad impulse
to ride into port under his own sails.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll have to tell her that he did a fine thing in coming
back for me, much as he hated to do it. What's more,
I shan't say a word about his beastly temper. We'll let
it pass. He deserves a whole lot for the part he played.
I'll not forget it. Too bad he had to spoil it all by talking
as he did. But, hang me, if he shall exact anything
from her because he did a thing he didn't want to do.
I took a darned sight bigger chance than he did, after
all. Good Lord, what a mess I would have been in if
the nag hadn't stopped! Whew! Well, old boy, you
did stop, God bless you. Colonel,&quot; he spoke, as Quinnox
came up, &quot;do you think I can buy this horse? He's
got more sense than I have.&quot;</p>

<p>Small bodies of foot soldiers and policemen fighting
valiantly against great odds were admitted to the
grounds during the next half hour. Scores had been
killed by the fierce, irregular attack of the revolutionists;
others had become separated from their comrades
and were even now being hunted down and destroyed
by the infuriated followers of Marlanx. A hundred
or more of the reserves reached the upper gates
before it occurred to the enemy to blockade the streets
in that neighbourhood. General Braze, with a few of his
men, bloody and heartsick, was the last of the little
army to reach safety in the Castle grounds, coming up
by way of the lower gates from the fortress, which they
had tried to reach after the first outbreak, but had found
themselves forestalled.</p>

<p>The fortress, with all guns, stores and ammunition, was
in the hands of the Iron Count and his cohorts.</p>

<p>Baron Dangloss had been taken prisoner with a whole
platoon of fighting constables. This was the last appalling
bit of news to reach the horrified, disorganised
forces in the Castle grounds.</p>

<p>Citizens had fled to their homes, unmolested. The
streets were empty, save for the armed minions of the
Iron Count. They rushed hither and thither in violent
detachments, seeking out the men in uniform, yelling
and shooting like unmanageable savages.</p>

<p>Before two o'clock the city itself was in the hands of
the hated enemy of the Crown. He and his aliens, malefactors
and all, were in complete control of the fortress,
the gates and approaches, the Tower and the bloody
streets. A thousand of them,&mdash;eager, yelling ruffians,&mdash;marched
to within firing distance of the Castle walls and
held every approach against reinforcements. Except
for the failure to destroy the Prince and his counsellors,
the daring, unspeakable plans of Count Marlanx had
been attended by the most horrifying results. He was
master. There was no question as to that. The few
hundred souls in the Castle grounds were like rats in a
trap.</p>

<p>A wise as well as a cruel man was Marlanx. He lost
no time in issuing a manifesto to the stunned, demoralised
citizens of Edelweiss. Scores of criers went
through the streets during the long, wretched afternoon,
announcing to the populace that Count Marlanx had
established himself as dictator and military governor of
the principality&mdash;pending the abdication of the Prince
and the beginning of a new and substantial regime. All
citizens were commanded to recognise the authority of
the dictator; none except those who disobeyed or resented
this authority would be molested. Traffic would
be resumed on the following Monday. Tradespeople
and artisans were commanded to resume their occupations
under penalty of extreme punishment in case of
refusal. These and many other edicts were issued from
Marlanx's temporary headquarters in the Plaza&mdash;almost
at the foot of the still veiled monument of the beloved
Princess Yetive.</p>

<p>Toward evening, after many consultations and countless
reports, Marlanx removed his headquarters to the
Tower. He had fondly hoped to be in the Castle long
before this. His rage and disappointment over the
stupid miscarriage of plans left no room for conjecture
as to the actual state of his feelings. For hours he had
raved like a madman. Every soldier who fell into his
hands was shot down like a dog.</p>

<p>The cells and dungeons in the great old tower were
now occupied by bruised, defeated officers of the law.
Baron Jasto Dangloss, crushed in spirit and broken of
body, paced the blackest and narrowest cell of them all.
The gall and wormwood that filled his soul was not to
be measured by words. He blamed himself for the catastrophe;
it was he who had permitted this appalling
thing to grow and burst with such sickening results. In
his mind there was no doubt that Marlanx had completely
overthrown the dynasty and was in full possession
of the government. He did not know that the
Prince and his court had succeeded in reaching the
Castle, whose walls and gates were well-nigh impregnable
to assault, even by a great army. If he had
known this he might have rejoiced!</p>

<p>Late in the evening he received a visit from Marlanx,
the new master.</p>

<p>The Iron Count, lighted by a ghostly lantern in the
hands of a man who, ten hours before, had been a
prisoner within these very walls, came up to the narrow
grating that served as a door and gazed complacently
upon the once great minister of police.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Dangloss, his eyes snapping, &quot;what is it,
damn you?&quot;</p>

<p>Marlanx stroked his chin and smiled. &quot;I believe this
is my old confr&egrave;re, Baron Dangloss,&quot; he remarked.
&quot;Dear me, I took you, sir, to be quite impeccable. Here
you are, behind the bars. Will wonders never cease?&quot;</p>

<p>Dangloss merely glared at him.</p>

<p>The Iron Count went on suavely: &quot;You heard me,
Baron. Still, I do not require an answer. How do you
like your new quarters? It may please you to know that
I am occupying your office, and also that noble suite
overlooking the Plaza. I find myself most agreeably
situated. By the way, Baron, I seem to recall something
to mind as I look at you. You were the kindly
disposed gentleman who escorted me to the city gates a
few years ago and there turned me over to a detachment
of soldiers, who, in turn, conveyed me to the border. If
I recall the occasion rightly, you virtually kicked me
out of the city. Am I right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are!&quot; was all that the bitter Dangloss said, without
taking his fierce gaze from the sallow face beyond
the bars.</p>

<p>&quot;I am happy to find that my memory is so good,&quot; said
Marlanx.</p>

<p>&quot;I expect to be able to repeat the operation,&quot; said
Dangloss.</p>

<p>&quot;How interesting! You forget that history never repeats
itself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See here, Marlanx, what is your game? Speak up;
I'm not afraid of you. Do you intend to take me out
and shoot me at sunrise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear me, no! That would be a silly proceeding.
You own vast estates in Graustark, if I mistake not, just
as I did eight or nine years ago. Well, I have come
into my own again. The Crown relieved me of my
estates, my citizenship, my honour. I have waited long
to regain them. Understand me, Dangloss; I am in
control now; my word is law. I do not intend to kill
you. It is my intention to escort you to the border and
kick you out of Graustark. See for yourself how it
feels. Everything you possess is to be taken away from
you. You will be a wanderer on the face of the earth&mdash;a
pauper. All you have is here. Therein lies the
distinction: I had large possessions in other lands. I
had friends and a following, as you see. You will have
none of these, Baron.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A splendid triumph, you beast!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, you'd much prefer being shot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. Banish me, if you please; strip me of all
I possess. But I'll come back another day, Count
Marlanx.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes; that reminds me. I had quite forgotten to
say that the first ten years of your exile are to be spent
in the dungeons at Schloss Marlanx. How careless of
me to have neglected to state that in the beginning. In
ten years you will be seventy-five, Baron. An excellent
time of life for one to begin his wanderings over the
world which will not care to remember him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you expect me to get down on my knees and plead
for mercy, you scoundrel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know you too well for that, my dear Baron.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get out of my sight!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pray do not forget that I am governor of the Tower
at present. I go and come as I choose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God will punish you for what you have done. There's
solace in that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As you like, Baron. If it makes it easier for you to
feel that God will take a hand in my humble affairs, all
well and good. I grant you that delectable privilege.&quot;</p>

<p>Baron Dangloss turned his back upon his smiling
enemy, his body quivering with passion.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, Baron, would you care to hear all the
latest news from the seat of war? It may interest you
to know that the Castle is besieged in most proper
fashion. No one&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Castle besieged? Then, by the Eternal, you did
not take the Prince!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all! He is in the Castle for a few hours of
imaginary safety. To-night my men will be admitted
to the grounds by friends who have served two masters
for a twelve-month or longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Traitors in the Castle?&quot; cried Dangloss in horror.
He was now facing the Count.</p>

<p>&quot;Hardly that, my dear sir. Agents, I should call them.
Isn't it splendid?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are a&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't say it, Baron. Save your breath. I know what
you would call me, and can save you the trouble of
shouting it, as you seem inclined to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God, your assassins not only failed to
dynamite the boy, but your dogs failed to capture him.
By heaven, God <i>is</i> with Prince Robin, after all!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How exalted you seem, Baron! It is a treat to look
at you. Oh, another thing: the Platanova girl was not
<i>my</i> assassin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a lie!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You shall not chide me in that fashion, Baron. You
are very rude. No; the girl was operating for what I
have since discovered to be the Committee of Ten, leading
the Party of Equals in Graustark. To-morrow
morning I shall have the Committee of Ten seized and
shot in the public square. We cannot harbour dynamiters
and assassins of that type. There are two-score
or more of anarchist sympathisers here. We will cheerfully
shoot all of them&mdash;an act that you should have
performed many days ago, my astute friend. It might
have saved trouble. They are a dangerous element in
any town. Those whom I do not kill I shall transport
to the United States in exchange for the Americans who
have managed to lose themselves over here. A fair exchange,
you see. Moreover, I hear that the United
States Government welcomes the Reds if they are white
instead of yellow. Clever, but involved, eh? Well,
good night, Baron. Sleep well. I expect to see you
again after the rush of business attending the adjustment
of my own particular affairs. In a day or two I
shall move into the Castle. You may be relieved to
know that I do not expect to find the time to kick you
out of Graustark under a week or ten days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My men: what of them? The brave fellows who were
taken with me? You will not deprive&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In time they will be given the choice of serving me as
policemen or serving the world as examples of folly.
Rest easy concerning them. Ah, yes, again I have
stupidly forgotten something. Your excellent friend,
Tullis, will not re-enter Edelweiss alive. That is quite
assured, sir. So you see, he will, after all, be better off
than you. I don't blame him for loving my wife. It
was my desire to amicably trade my wife off to him for
his charming sister, but the deal hangs fire. What a
scowl! I dare say you contemplate saying something
bitter, so I'll retire. A little later on I shall be
chatting with the Prince at the Castle. I'll give him
your gentlest felicitations.&quot;</p>

<p>But Marlanx was doomed to another disappointment
before the night was over. The Castle gates were not
opened to his forces. Colonel Quinnox apprehended the
traitors in time to prevent the calamity. Ten hostlers
in the Royal stables were taken redhanded in the attempt
to overpower the small guard at the western gates.
Their object was made plain by the subsequent futile
movement of a large force of men at that particular
point.</p>

<p>Prince Robin was safe for the night.</p>

<h3>TRUXTON ON PARADE</h3>


<p>Count Marlanx was a soldier. He knew how to take
defeat and to bide his time; he knew how to behave in
the hour of victory and in the moment of rout. The
miscarriage of a detail here and there in this vast, comprehensive
plan of action did not in the least sense
discourage him. It was no light blow to his calculations,
of course, when the designs of an organisation
separate and distinct from his own failed in their purpose.
It was part of his plan to hold the misguided
Reds responsible for the lamentable death of Prince
Robin. The people were to be given swift, uncontrovertible
proof that he had no hand in the unforeseen transactions
of the anarchists, who, he would make it appear,
had by curious coincidence elected to kill the Prince
almost at the very hour when he planned to seize the
city as a conqueror.</p>

<p>His own connection with the operations of the mysterious
Committee of Ten was never to be known to the
world. He would see to that.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock on Sunday morning a small group of
people gathered in the square: a meeting was soon in
progress. A goods-box stood over against the very
spot on which Olga Platanova died. An old man began
haranguing the constantly growing crowd, made up
largely of those whose curiosity surpassed discreetness.
In the group might have been seen every member of the
Committee of Ten, besides a full representation of those
who up to now had secretly affiliated with the Party of
Equals. A red flag waved above the little, excited group
of fanatics, close to the goods-box rostrum. One member
of the Committee was absent from this, their first
public espousal of the cause. Later on we are to discover
who this man was. Two women in bright red waists
were crying encouragement to the old man on the box,
whose opening sentences were no less than an unchanted
requiem for the dead martyr, Olga Platanova.</p>

<p>In the midst of his harangue, the hand of William
Spantz was arrested in one of its most emphatic gestures.
A look of wonder and uncertainty came into his face as
he gazed, transfixed, over the heads of his hearers in the
direction of the Tower.</p>

<p>Peter Brutus was approaching, at the head of a group
of aliens, all armed and marching in ominously good
order. Something in the face of Peter Brutus sent a
chill of apprehension into the very soul of the old
armourer.</p>

<p>And well it may have done so.</p>

<p>&quot;One moment!&quot; called out Peter Brutus, lifting his
hand imperatively. The speaker ceased his mouthings.
&quot;Count Marlanx desires the immediate presence of the
following citizens at his office in the Tower. I shall call
off the names.&quot; He began with William Spantz. The
name of each of his associates in the Committee of Ten
followed. After them came a score of names, all of them
known to be supporters of the anarchist cause.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the business, Peter?&quot; demanded William
Spantz.</p>

<p>&quot;Does it mean we are to begin so soon the establishing
of the new order&mdash;&quot; began Anna Cromer, her face
aglow. Peter smiled wanly.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not ask me,&quot; he said, emphasising the pronoun.
&quot;I am only commanded to bring the faithful few before
him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why the armed escort?&quot; growled Julius Spantz,
who had spent an unhappy twenty-four hours in bondage.</p>

<p>&quot;To separate the wheat from the chaff,&quot; said Peter.
&quot;Move on, good people, all you whose names were not
called.&quot; The order was to the few timid strangers who
were there because they had nowhere else to go. They
scattered like chaff.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later every member of the Committee of
Ten, except Peter Brutus, was behind lock and bar, together
with their shivering associates, all of them
dumbly muttering to themselves the awful sentence that
Marlanx had passed upon them.</p>

<p>&quot;You are to die at sunset. Graustark still knows how
to punish assassins. She will make an example of you
to-day that all creatures of your kind, the world over,
will not be likely to forget in a century to come. There
is no room in Graustark for anarchy. I shall wipe it
out to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, your promise!&quot; gasped William Spantz. &quot;We
are your friends&mdash;the true Party of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough! Do not speak again! Captain Brutus, you
will send criers abroad to notify the citizens that I,
Count Marlanx, have ordered the execution of the ringleaders
in the plot to dynamite the Prince. At sunset,
in the square. Away with the carrion!&quot;</p>

<p>Then it was, and not till then, that the Committee of
Ten found him out! Then it was that they came to
know Peter Brutus! What were their thoughts, we
dare not tell: their shrieks and curses were spent against
inpenetrable floors and walls. Baron Dangloss heard,
and, in time, understood. Even he shrank back and
shuddered.</p>

<p>It has been said that Marlanx was a soldier. There is
one duty that the soldier in command never neglects:
the duty to those who fell while fighting bravely for or
against him. Sunday afternoon a force of men was set
to work burying the dead and clearing the pavements.
Those of his own nondescript army who gave up their
lives on the 26th were buried in the public cemeteries.
The soldiers of the Crown, as well as the military police,
were laid to rest in the national cemetery, with honours
befitting their rank. Each grave was carefully marked
and a record preserved. In this way Marlanx hoped
to obtain his first footing in the confidence and esteem
of the citizens. The unrecognisable corpse of Olga
Platanova was buried in quicklime outside the city walls.
There was something distinctly gruesome in the fact
that half a dozen deep graves were dug alongside hers,
hours before death came to the wretches who were to
occupy them.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the Iron Count coolly sent messengers
to the homes of the leading merchants and bankers of
the city. They, with the priests, the doctors, the municipal
officers and the manufacturers were commanded to
appear before him at five o'clock for the purpose of
discussing the welfare of the city and its people. Hating,
yet fearing him, they came; not one but felt in his heart
that the old man was undisputed ruler of their destinies.
Hours of horror and despair, a night and a day of
bitter reflection, had brought the trembling populace to
the point of seeing clearly the whole miserable situation.
The reserves were powerless; the Royal Guard was besieged
and greatly outnumbered; the fortress was lost.
There was nothing for them to do but temporise. Time
alone could open the way to salvation.</p>

<p>Marlanx stated his position clearly. He left no room
for doubt in their minds. The strings were in his hands:
he had but to pull them. The desire of his life was about
to be attained. Without hesitation he informed the
leading men of the city that he was to be the Prince of
Graustark.</p>

<p>&quot;I have the city,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;The farms and
villages will fall in line. I do not worry over them.
In a very short time I shall have the Castle. The question
for you to decide for yourselves is this: will you be
content to remain here as thrifty, peaceable citizens,
protecting your fortunes and being protected by a man
and not by a child. If not, please say so. The alternative
is in the hands of the Crown. I am the Crown. The
Crown may at any time confiscate property and banish
malcontents and disturbers. A word to the wise, gentlemen.
Inside of a week we will have a new government.
You will not suffer under its administration. I should
be indeed a fool to destroy the credit or injure the integrity
of my own dominion. But, let me say this,
gentlemen,&quot; he went on after a pause, in which his
suavity gave way to harshness; &quot;you may as well understand
at the outset that I expect to rule here. I will
rule Graustark or destroy her.&quot;</p>

<p>The more courageous in his audience began to protest
against the high-handed manner in which he proposed
to treat them. Not a few declared that they would
never recognise him as a prince of the realm. He waited,
as a spider waits, until he thought they had gone far
enough. Then he held up his hand and commanded
silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Those of you who do not expect or desire to live
under my rule&mdash;which, I promise you, shall be a wise
one,&mdash;may leave the city for other lands just as soon
as my deputies have completed the formal transfer of
all your belongings to the Crown treasury&mdash;all, I say,
even to the minutest trifle. Permit me to add, in that
connection, gentlemen: the transfer will not be a prolonged
affair.&quot;</p>

<p>They glared back at him and subsided into bitter
silence.</p>

<p>&quot;I am well aware that you love little Prince Robin. Ha!
You may not cheer here, gentlemen, under penalty of my
displeasure. It is quite right that you should, as loyal
subjects, love your Prince, whoever he may be. I shall
certainly expect it. Now, respecting young master
Robin: I have no great desire to kill him.&quot;</p>

<p>He waited to see the effect of this brutal announcement.
His hearers stiffened and&mdash;yes, they held their breath.</p>

<p>&quot;He has one alternative&mdash;he and his lords. I trust
that you, as sensible gentlemen, will find the means to
convey to him your advice that he seize the opportunity
I shall offer him to escape with his life. No one really
wants to see the little chap die. Let me interrupt myself
to call to your attention the fact that I am punishing
the anarchists at sunset. This to convince you that
assassination will not be tolerated in Graustark. To
resume: the boy may return to America, where he belongs.
He is more of an American than one of us. I
will give him free and safe escort to the United States.
Certain of his friends may accompany him; others
whom I shall designate will be required to remain here
until I have disposed of their cases as I see fit. These
conditions I shall set forth in my manifesto to the
present occupant of the Castle. If he chooses to accept
my kindly terms, all well and good. If not, gentlemen,
I shall starve him out or blow the Castle down about
his smart little ears. You shudder! Well, I can't blame
you. I shudder myself sometimes when I think of it.
There will be a great deal of royal blood, you know. Ah,
that reminds me: It may interest you to hear that I
expect to establish a new nobility in Graustark. The
present house of lords is objectionable to me. I trust
I may now be addressing at least a few of the future
noble lords of Graustark. Good day, gentlemen. That
is all for the present. Kindly inform me if any of my
soldiers or followers overstep the bounds of prudence.
Rapine and ribaldry will not be tolerated.&quot;</p>

<p>The dignitaries and great men of the city went away,
dazed and depressed, looking at each other from bloodshot
eyes. Not one friend had Marlanx in that group,
and he knew it well. He did not expect them to submit
at once or even remotely. They might have smiled,
whereas they frowned, if they could have seen him
pacing the floor of his office, the moment the doors closed
behind their backs, clenching his hands and cursing
furiously.</p>

<p>At the Castle the deepest gloom prevailed. It was like
a nightmare to the beleaguered household, a dream from
which there seemed to be no awakening. Colonel Quinnox's
first act after posting his forces in position to
repel attacks from the now well-recognised enemy, was
to make sure of the safety of his royal master. Inside
the walls of the Castle grounds he, as commander of the
Royal Guard, ruled supreme. General Braze tore off
his own epaulets and presented himself to Quinnox as a
soldier of the file; lords and dukes, pages and ministers,
followed the example of the head of the War Department.
No one stood on the dignity of his position; no
one does, as a rule, with the executioner staring him in the
face. Every man took up arms for the defence of the
Castle, its Prince and its lovely women.</p>

<p>Prince Robin, quite recovered from his fright, donned
the uniform of a Colonel of the Royal Dragoons, buckled
on his jewelled sword, and, with boyish zeal, demanded
Colonel Quinnox's reasons for not going forth to slay the
rioters.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the army for, Colonel Quinnox?&quot; he asked
with impatient wonder.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon and the Prince was seated
in the chair of state, presiding over the hurriedly called
Council meeting. Notably absent were Baron Dangloss
and the Duke of Perse. Chief officers of the Guard and
the commissioned men of the army were present&mdash;that
is, all of them who had not gone down under the treacherous fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness,&quot; said the Colonel bitterly, &quot;the real
army is outside the walls, not inside. We are a pitiful
handful-less than three hundred men, all told, counting
the wounded. Count Marlanx heads an army of
several thousand. He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wants to get in here so's he can kill me? Is that
so, Colonel Quinnox?&quot; The Prince was very pale, but
quite calm.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I wouldn't put it just that way, your&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know. You can't fool me. I've always known
that he wants to kill me. But how can he? That's the
question; how can he when I've got the Royal Guard to
keep him from doing it? He can't whip the Royal
Guard. Nobody can. He ought to know that. He
must be awful stupid.&quot;</p>

<p>His perfect, unwavering faith in the Guard was the
same that had grown up with every prince of Graustark
and would not be gainsaid. A score of hearts swelled
with righteous pride and as many scabbards rattled as
heels clicked and hands went up in salute.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Highness,&quot; said Quinnox, with a glance at his
fellow-officers, &quot;you may rely upon it, Count Marlanx
will never reach you until he has slain every man in the
Royal Guard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And in the army&mdash;our poor little army,&quot; added General
Braze.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the Prince. &quot;You needn't have
told me. I knew it.&quot; He leaned back in the big chair,
almost slipping from the record books on which he sat,
a brave scowl on his face. &quot;Gee, I wish he'd attack us
right now,&quot; he said, with ingenuous bravado.</p>

<p>The council of war was not a lengthy one. The storm
that had arisen out of a perfectly clear sky was briefly
discussed in all its phases. No man there but realised the
seriousness of the situation. Count Halfont, who
seemed ten years older than when we last saw him, addressed
the Cabinet.</p>

<p>&quot;John Tullis is still outside the city walls. If he does
not fall into a trap through ignorance of the city's
plight, I firmly believe he will be able to organise an
army of relief among the peasants and villagers. They
are loyal. The mountaineers and shepherds, wild fellows
all, and the ones who have fallen into the spider's net.
Count Marlanx has an army of aliens; they are not even
revolutionists. John Tullis, if given the opportunity,
can sweep the city clear of them. My only fear is that
he may be tricked into ambush before we can reach him.
No doubt Marlanx, in devising a way to get him out of
the city, also thought of the means to keep him out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We must get word to Tullis,&quot; cried several in a breath.
A dozen men volunteered to risk their lives in the attempt
to find the American in the hills. Two men were chosen&mdash;by
lot. They were to venture forth that very night.</p>

<p>&quot;My lords,&quot; said the Prince, as the Council was on the
point of dissolving, &quot;is it all right for me to ask a question
now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly, Robin,&quot; said the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'd like to know where Mr. King is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's safe, your Highness,&quot; said Quinnox.</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Loraine is worried, that's all. She's sick, you
see&mdash;awful sick. Do you think Mr. King would be
good enough to walk by her window, so's she can see for
herself? She's in the royal bedchamber.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The royal bedchamber?&quot; gasped the high chamberlain.</p>

<p>&quot;I gave up my bed right off, but she won't stay in it.
She sits in the window most of the time. It's all right
about the bed. I spoke to nurse about it. Besides, I
don't want to go to bed while there's any fighting going
on. So, you see, it's all right. Say, Uncle Caspar, may
I take a crack at old Marlanx with my new rifle if I
get a chance? I've been practising on the target range,
and Uncle Jack says I'm a reg'lar Buffalo Bill.&quot;</p>

<p>Count Halfont unceremoniously hugged his wriggling
grand-nephew. A cheer went up from the others.</p>

<p>&quot;Long live Prince Robin!&quot; shouted Count Vos Engo.</p>

<p>Prince Robin looked abashed. &quot;I don't think I could
hit him,&quot; he said with becoming modesty. They laughed
aloud. &quot;But, say, don't forget about Mr. King. Tell
him I want him to parade most of the time in front of
my windows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has a weak ankle,&quot; began Colonel Quinnox lamely.</p>

<p>&quot;Very difficult for him to walk,&quot; said Vos Engo, biting
his lips.</p>

<p>The Prince looked from face to face, suspicion in his
eyes. It dawned on him that they were evading the
point. A stubborn line appeared between his brows.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I command you, Colonel Quinnox, to give him
the best horse in the stables. I want him to ride.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It shall be as you command, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, his grand-uncle, the Prime
Minister, was carrying him down the corridor; Prince
Robin was perched upon the old man's shoulder, and was
a thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Uncle Caspar, Mr. King's all right, isn't he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is a very brave and noble gentleman, Bobby. We
owe to his valour the life of the best boy in all the
world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and Aunt Loraine owes him a lot, too. She says
so. She's been crying, Uncle Caspar. Say, has she
just got to marry Count Vos Engo?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My boy, what put that question into your mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She says she has to. I thought only princes and
princesses had to marry people they don't want to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should not believe all that you hear.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobby was silent for twenty steps. Then he said:
&quot;Well, I think she'll make an awful mistake if she lets
Mr. King get away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My boy, we have other affairs to trouble us at present
without taking up the affairs of Miss Tullis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he saved her life, just like they do in story
books,&quot; protested the Prince.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you run in and tell her this minute that Mr.
King sends his love to her and begs her to rest easy.
See if it doesn't cheer her up a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe she's worried about Uncle Jack. I never
thought about that,&quot; he faltered.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle Jack will come out on top, never fear,&quot; cried
the old man.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Truxton King, shaven and shorn,
outfitted and polished, received orders to ride for twenty
minutes back and forth across the Plaza. He came
down from Colonel Quinnox's rooms in the officer's row,
considerably mystified, and mounted the handsome bay
that he had brought through the gates. Haddan, of
the Guard, rode with him to the Plaza, but could offer
no explanation for the curious command.</p>

<p>Five times the now resentful American walked his horse
across the Plaza, directly in front of the terrace and the
great balconies. About him paced guardsmen, armed
and alert; on the outer edge of the parade ground a
company of soldiers were hurrying through the act of
changing the Guard; in the lower balcony excited men
and women were walking back and forth, paying not the
least attention to him. Above him frowned the grey,
lofty walls of the Castle. No one was in view on the
upper balcony, beyond which he had no doubt lay the
royal chambers. He had the mean, uncomfortable feeling
that people were peering at him from remote windows.</p>

<p>Suddenly a small figure in bright red and gold and
waving a tiny sword appeared at the rail of the broad
upper gallery. Truxton blinked his eyes once or, twice
and then doffed his hat. The Prince was smiling eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; he called. Truxton drew rein directly below
him.</p>

<p>&quot;I trust your Highness has recovered from the shock
of to-day,&quot; he responded. &quot;I have been terribly anxious.
Are you quite well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite well, thank you.&quot; He hesitated for a moment,
as if in doubt. Then: &quot;Say, Mr. King, how's your
leg?&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton looked around in sudden embarrassment. A
number of distressed, white-faced ladies had paused in
the lower gallery and were staring at him in mingled
curiosity and alarm. He instantly wondered if Colonel
Quinnox's riding clothes were as good a fit as he had
been led to believe through Hobbs and others.</p>

<p>&quot;It's&mdash;it's fine, thank you,&quot; he called up, trying to
subdue his voice as much as possible.</p>

<p>Bobby looked a trifle uncertain. His glance wavered
and a queer little wrinkle appeared between his eyes.
He lowered his voice when he next spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Say, would you mind shouting that a little louder,&quot;
he called down, leaning well over the rail.</p>

<p>Truxton flushed. He was pretty sure that the Prince
was not deaf. There was no way out of it, however, so
he repeated his communication.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all right, your Highness.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobby gave a quick glance over his shoulder at one
of the broad windows. Truxton distinctly saw the blinds
close with a convulsive jerk.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks! Much obliged! Good-bye!&quot; sang out the
Prince, gleefully. He waved his hand and then hopped
off the chair on which he was standing. Truxton heard
his little heels clatter across the stone balcony. For a
moment he was nonplused.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm&mdash;By Jove! I understand!&quot; He rode off
toward the barracks, his head swimming with joy, his
heart jumping like mad. At the edge of the parade
ground he turned in his saddle and audaciously lifted
his hat to the girl who, to his certain knowledge, was
standing behind the tell-tale blind.</p>

<p>&quot;Cheer up, Hobbs!&quot; he sang out in his new-found
exuberance as he rode up to the dismal Englishman,
who moped in the shade of the stable walls. &quot;Don't be
down-hearted. Look at me! Never say die, that's my
motto.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's all very well, sir,&quot; said Hobbs, removing the
unlighted pipe from his lips, &quot;but you 'aven't got a dog
and a parrot locked up in your rooms with no one to
feed them. It makes me sick, 'pon my soul, sir, to
think of them dying of thirst and all that, and me here
safe and sound, so to speak.&quot;</p>

<p>That night Haddan and a fellow-subaltern attempted
to leave the Castle grounds by way of the private gate
in the western wall, only to be driven back by careful
watchers on the outside. A second attempt was made
at two o'clock. This time they went through the crypt
into the secret underground passage. As they crawled
forth into the blackest of nights, clear of the walls,
they were met by a perfect fusillade of rifle shots. Haddan's
companion was shot through the leg and arm and
it was with extreme difficulty that the pair succeeded in
regaining the passage and closing the door. No other
attempt was made that night. Sunday night a quick
sortie was made, it being the hope of the besieged that
two selected men might elude Marlanx's watch-dogs
during the melee that followed. Curiously enough, the
only men killed were the two who had been chosen to run
the gauntlet in the gallant, but ill-timed attempt to
reach John Tullis.</p>

<p>On Monday morning the first direct word from Count
Marlanx came to the Castle. Under a flag of truce, two
of his men were admitted to the grounds. They presented
the infamous ultimatum of the Iron Count. In brief, it
announced the establishment of a dictatorship pending
the formal assumption of the crown by the conqueror.
With scant courtesy the Iron Count begged to inform
Prince Robin that his rule was at an end. Surrender
would result in his safe conduct to America, the home of
his father; defiance would just so surely end in death
for him and all of his friends. The Prince was given
twenty-four hours in which to surrender his person to
the new governor of the city. With the expiration of
the time limit mentioned, the Castle would be shelled from
the fortress, greatly as the dictator might regret the
destruction of the historic and well-beloved structure.
No one would be spared if it became necessary to bombard;
the rejection of his offer of mercy would be taken
as a sign that the defenders were ready to die for a lost
cause. He would cheerfully see to it that they died as
quickly as possible, in order that the course of government
might not be obstructed any longer than necessary.</p>

<p>The defenders of the Castle tore his message in two and
sent it back to him without disfiguring it by a single
word in reply. The scornful laughter which greeted
the reading of the document by Count Halfont did not
lose any of its force in the report that the truce-bearers
carried, with considerable uneasiness, to the Iron
Count later on.</p>

<p>No one in the Castle was deceived by Marlanx's promise
to provide safe conduct for the Prince. They knew
that the boy was doomed if he fell into the hands of this
iniquitous old schemer. More than that, there was not
a heart among them so faint that it was not confident
of eventual victory over the usurper. They could hold
out for weeks against starvation. Hope is an able provider.</p>

<p>A single, distant volley at sunset had puzzled the men
on guard at the Castle. They had no means of knowing
that the Committee of Ten and its wretched friends
had been shot down like dogs in the Public Square.
Peter Brutus was in charge of the squad of executioners.</p>

<p>Soon after the return of Marlanx's messengers to the
Tower, a number of carriages were observed approaching
in Castle Avenue. They were halted a couple of
hundred yards from the gates and once more a flag of
truce was presented. There was a single line from
Marlanx:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&quot;I am sending indisputable witnesses to bear testimony
to the thoroughness of my conquest.</p>
<br />
&quot;MARLANX.&quot;<br />
<br />
</div>

<p>Investigation convinced the captain of the Guard that
the motley caravan in the avenue was made up of loyal,
representative citizens from the important villages of
the realm. They were admitted to the grounds without
question.</p>

<p>The Countess Prandeville of Ganlook, terribly agitated,
was one of the first to enter the haven of safety,
such as it was. After her came the mayors and the
magistrates of a dozen villages. Count Marlanx's reason
for delivering these people over to their friends in
the Castle was at once manifest.</p>

<p>By the words of their mouths his almost complete
mastery of the situation was conveyed to the Prince's
defenders. In every instance the representative from
a village sorrowfully admitted that Marlanx's men were
in control. Ganlook, an ancient stronghold, had been
taken without a struggle by a handful of men. The
Countess's husband was even now confined in his own
castle under guard.</p>

<p>The news was staggering. Count Halfont had based
his strongest hopes on the assistance that would naturally
come from the villages. Moreover, the strangely
commissioned emissaries cast additional gloom over the
situation by the report that mountaineers, herdsmen and
woodchoppers in the north were flocking to the assistance
of the Iron Count, followed by hordes of outlaws
from the Axphain hills. They were swarming into the
city. These men had always been thorns in the sides of
the Crown's peace-makers.</p>

<p>&quot;It is worse than I thought,&quot; said Count Halfont, after
listening to the words of the excited magistrates. &quot;Are
there no loyal men outside these walls?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thousands, sir, but they are not organised. They
have no leader, and but little with which to fight against
such a force.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is hard to realise that a force of three or four thousand
desperadoes has the power to defy an entire kingdom.
A city of 75,000 people in the hands of hirelings!
The shame of it!&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton King was leaning against a column not far
from the little group, nervously pulling away at the
pipe Quinnox had given him. As if impelled by a common
thought, a half dozen pairs of eyes were turned in
his direction. Their owners looked as quickly away,
again moved by a common thought.</p>

<p>The Minister of Mines gave utterance to a single sentence
that might well have been called the epitome of
that shrewd, concentrated thought:</p>

<p>&quot;There must be some one who can get to John Tullis
before it is too late.&quot;</p>

<p>They looked at one another and then once more at the
American who had come among them, avowedly in quest
of adventure.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX" />CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>TRUXTON EXACTS A PROMISE</h3>


<p>Truxton King had been in a resentful frame of mind
for nearly forty-eight hours. In the first place, he had
not had so much as a single glimpse of the girl he now
worshipped with all his heart. In the second place, he
had learned, with unpleasant promptness, that Count
Vos Engo was the officer in command of the House
Guard, a position as gravely responsible as it was honourable.
The cordon about the Castle was so tightly drawn
in these perilous hours that even members of the household
were subjected to examination on leaving or entering.</p>

<p>Truxton naturally did not expect to invade the Castle
in search of the crumb of comfort he so ardently desired;
he did not, however, dream that Vos Engo would deny
him the privilege of staring at a certain window from a
rather prim retreat in a far corner of the Plaza.</p>

<p>He had, of course, proffered his services to Colonel
Quinnox. The Colonel, who admired the Americans,
gravely informed him that there was no regular duty
to which he could be assigned, but that he would expect
him to hold himself ready for any emergency. In case
of an assault, he was to report to Count Vos Engo.</p>

<p>&quot;We will need our bravest men at the Castle,&quot; he had
said. Truxton glowed under the compliment. &quot;In the
meantime, Mr. King, regain your strength in the park.
You show the effect of imprisonment. Your adventures
have been most interesting, but I fancy they invite rest
for the present.&quot;</p>

<p>It was natural that this new American should become
an object of tremendous interest to every one in and
about the Castle. The story of his mishaps and his
prowess was on every lip; his timely appearance in
Regengetz Circus was regarded in the light of divine
intervention, although no one questioned the perfectly
human pluck that brought it about. Noble ladies smiled
upon him in the park, to which they now repaired with
timorous hearts; counts and barons slapped him on the
back and doughty guardsmen actually saluted him with
admiration in their eyes.</p>

<p>But he was not satisfied. Loraine had not come forward
with a word of greeting or relief; in fact, she had
not appeared outside the Castle doors. Strangely
enough, with the entire park at his disposal, he chose to
frequent those avenues nearest the great balconies.
More than once he visited the grotto where he had first
seen her; but it was not the same. The occasional crack
of a rifle on the walls no longer fired him with the
interest he had felt in the beginning. Forty-eight
hours had passed and she still held aloof. What could
it mean? Was she ill? Had she collapsed after the
frightful strain?</p>

<p>Worse than anything else: was she devoting all of her
time to Count Vos Engo?</p>

<p>Toward dusk on Monday, long after the arrival of the
refugees, he sat in gloomy contemplation of his own
unhappiness, darkly glowering upon the unfriendly
portals from a distant stone bench.</p>

<p>A brisk guardsman separated himself from the knot
of men at the Castle doors and crossed the Plaza toward
him.</p>

<p>&quot;Aha,&quot; thought Truxton warmly, &quot;at last she is sending
a message to me. Perhaps she's&mdash;no, she couldn't
be sending for me to come to her.&quot;</p>

<p>Judge his dismay and anger when the soldier, a bit
shamefaced himself, briefly announced that Count Vos
Engo had issued an order against loitering in close
proximity to the Castle. Mr. King was inside the limit
described in the order. Would he kindly retire to a
more distant spot, etc.</p>

<p>Truxton's cheek burned. He saw in an instant that
the order was meant for him and for no one else&mdash;he
being the only outsider likely to come under the head
of &quot;loiterer.&quot; A sharp glance revealed the fact that
not only were the officers watching the little scene, but
others in the balcony were looking on.</p>

<p>Resisting the impulse to argue the point, he hastily
lifted his hat to the spectators and turned into the
avenue without a word.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry, sir,&quot; mentioned the guardsman earnestly.</p>

<p>Truxton turned to him with a frank smile, meant for
the group at the steps. &quot;Please tell Count Vos Engo
that I am the last person in the world to disregard
discipline at a time like this.&quot;</p>

<p>His glance again swept the balcony, suddenly becoming
fixed on a couple near the third column. Count Vos
Engo and Loraine Tullis were standing there together,
unmistakably watching his humiliating departure. To
say that Truxton swore softly as he hurried off through
the trees would be unnecessarily charitable.</p>

<p>The next morning he encountered Vos Engo near the
grotto. Two unsuccessful attempts to leave the Castle
grounds had been made during the night. Truxton had
aired his opinion to Mr. Hobbs after breakfast.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll bet my head I could get away with it,&quot; he had
said, doubly scornful because of a sleepless night. &quot;They
go about it like a lot of chumps. No wonder they are
chased back.&quot;</p>

<p>Catching sight of Vos Engo, he hastened across the
avenue and caught up to him. The Count was apparently
deep in thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Truxton from behind. The
other whirled quickly. He did not smile as he eyed the
tall American. &quot;I haven't had a chance to thank you
for coming back for me last Saturday. Allow me to
say that it was a very brave thing to do. If I appeared
ungrateful at the time, I'm sure you understood my
motives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The whole matter is of no consequence, Mr. King,&quot;
said the other quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Nevertheless, I consider it my duty to thank you. I
want to get it out of my system. Having purged myself
of all that, I now want to tell you of a discovery that
I made last evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am not at all interested.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will be when I have told you, however, because
it concerns you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not like your words, Mr. King, nor the way in
which you glare at me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm making it easier to tell you the agreeable news,
Count Vos Engo; that's all. You'll be delighted to
hear that I thought of you nearly all night and still
feel that I have not been able to do you full justice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot; with a distinct uplifting of the eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;Take your hand off your sword, please. Some other
time, perhaps, but not in these days when we need men,
not cripples. I'll tell you what I have discovered and
then we'll drop the matter until some other time. We
can afford a physical delay, but it would be heartless to
keep you in mental suspense. Frankly, Count, I have
made the gratifying discovery that you are a damned
cur.&quot;</p>

<p>Count Vos Engo went very white. He drew his dapper
figure up to its full height, swelled his Robin Redbreast
coat to the bursting point, and allowed his right hand
to fly to his sword. Then, as suddenly, he folded his
arms and glared at Truxton.</p>

<p>&quot;As you say, there is another and a better time. We
need dogs as well as men in these days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you won't forget that I thanked you for coming
back last Saturday.&quot;</p>

<p>The Count turned and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>Truxton leaned against the low wall alongside the
All&eacute;e. &quot;I don't know that I've helped matters any,&quot; he
said to himself ruefully. &quot;He'll not let me get within
half a mile of the Castle after this. If she doesn't come
out for a stroll in the park, I fancy I'll never see her&mdash;Heigho!
I wish something would happen! Why
doesn't Marlanx begin bombarding? It's getting
devilish monotonous here.&quot;</p>

<p>He strolled off to the stables, picking up Mr. Hobbs
on the way.</p>

<p>&quot;Hobbs,&quot; he said, &quot;we've got to find John Tullis,
that's all there is to it.&quot; He was scowling fiercely at
a most inoffensive lawn-mower in the grass at the left.</p>

<p>&quot;I daresay, sir,&quot; said Mr. Hobbs with sprightly decisiveness.
&quot;He's very much needed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to need him before long as my second.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your second, sir? Are you going to fight a duel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; lugubriously. &quot;It's too much to expect
him to meet me with bare fists. Oh, Hobbs, I wish we
could arrange it for bare knucks!&quot; He delivered a
mighty swing at an invisible adversary. Hobbs's hat
fell off with the backward jerk of surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my word!&quot; he exclaimed admiringly, &quot;wot a
punch you've got!&quot;</p>

<p>Later on, much of his good humour was restored and
his vanity pleased by a polite request from Count
Halfont to attend an important council in the &quot;Room
of Wrangles&quot; that evening at nine.</p>

<p>Very boldly he advanced upon the Castle a few
minutes before the appointed hour. He went alone, that
he might show a certain contempt for Count Vos Engo.
Notwithstanding the fact that he started early enough
for the Chamber, he was distressingly late for the
meeting.</p>

<p>He came upon Loraine Tullis at the edge of the
Terrace. She was walking slowly in the soft shadows
beyond the row of lights on the lower gallery. King
would have passed her without recognition, so dim was
the light in this enchanted spot, had not his ear caught
the sound of a whispered exclamation. At the same
time the girl stopped abruptly in the darkest shadow.
He knew her at a glance, this slim girl in spotless white.</p>

<p>&quot;Loraine!&quot; he whispered, reaching her side in two
bounds. She put out her hands and he clasped them.
A quick, hysterical little laugh came from her lips.
Plainly, she was confused. &quot;I've been dying for a
glimpse of you. Do you think you've treated me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't, Truxton,&quot; she pleaded, suddenly serious. She
sent a swift glance toward the balconies. &quot;You must
not come here. I saw&mdash;well, you know. I was so
ashamed. I was so sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>He still held her hands. His heart was throbbing
furiously.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they ordered me to move on, as if I were a common
loafer,&quot; he said, with a soft chuckle. &quot;I'm used
to it, however. They ran me out of Meshed for taking
snapshots; they banished me from Damascus, and they
all but kicked me out of Jerusalem&mdash;I won't say why.
But where have you kept yourself? Why have you
avoided me? After getting the Prince to parade me
in front of your windows, too. It's dirt mean, Loraine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been ill, Truxton&mdash;truly, I have,&quot; she said
quickly, uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;See here, what's wrong? You are in trouble. I can
tell by your manner. Tell me&mdash;trust me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am worried so dreadfully about John,&quot; she faltered.</p>

<p>&quot;That isn't all,&quot; he declared. &quot;There's something
else. What promise did you make to Vos Engo last
Saturday after&mdash;well, if you choose to recall it&mdash;after
I brought you back to him&mdash;what did you promise
him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be cruel, Truxton,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I cannot
forget all you have done for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You told Vos Engo to ride back and pick me up,&quot;
he persisted. &quot;He told me in so many words. Now, I
want a plain answer, Loraine. Did you promise to
reward him if he&mdash;well, if he saved me from the mob?&quot;</p>

<p>She was breathlessly silent for a moment. &quot;No,&quot; she
said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&quot;What was it, then? I must know, Loraine.&quot; He was
bending over her, imperiously.</p>

<p>&quot;I am very&mdash;oh, so very unhappy, Truxton,&quot; she
murmured. He was on the point of clasping her in his
arms and kissing her. But he thought better of it.</p>

<p>&quot;I came near spoiling everything just now,&quot; he
whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I almost kissed you, Loraine,&mdash;I swear it was hard
to keep from it. That would have spoiled everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it would,&quot; she agreed quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not going to kiss you until you have told me you
love Vos Engo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I don't understand,&quot; she cried, drawing back and
looking up into his face with bewildered eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Because then I'll be sure that you love me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be sensible, Truxton.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll know that you promised to love him if he'd save
me. It's as clear as day to me. You <i>did</i> tell him you'd
marry him if he got me to a place of safety.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. I <i>refused</i> to marry him if he did not save you.
Oh, Truxton, I am so miserable. What is to become of
all of us? What is to become of John, and Bobby&mdash;and
you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I think I'll kiss you now, Loraine,&quot; he whispered
almost tremulously. &quot;God, how I love you, little
darling!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't!&quot; she whispered, resolutely pushing him away
after a sweet second of indecision. &quot;I cannot&mdash;I cannot,
Truxton dear. Don't ask me to&mdash;to do that. Not
now, please&mdash;not now!&quot;</p>

<p>He stiffened; his hands dropped to his sides, but there
was joy in his voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I can wait,&quot; he said gently. &quot;It's only a matter of
a few days; and I&mdash;I won't make it any harder for you
just now. I think I understand. You've&mdash;you've sort
of pledged yourself to that&mdash;to him, and you don't
think it fair to&mdash;well, to any of us. I'm including you,
you see. I know you don't love him, and I know that
you're going to love me, even if you don't at this very
instant. I'm not a very stupid person, after all. I can
see through things. I saw through it all when he came
back for me. That's why I jumped from his horse and
took my chances elsewhere. He did a plucky thing,
Loraine, but I&mdash;I couldn't let it go as he intended it to
be. Confound him, I would have died a thousand times
over rather than have you sacrifice yourself in that way.
It was splendid of you, darling, but&mdash;but very foolish.
You've got yourself into a dreadful mess over it. I've
got to rescue you all over again. This time, thank the
Lord, from a Castle.&quot;</p>

<p>She could not help smiling. His joyousness would not
be denied.</p>

<p>&quot;How splendid you are!&quot; she said, her voice thrilling
with a tone that could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>He put his hands upon her shoulders and looked down
into the beautiful, upturned face, a genuinely serious
note creeping into his voice when he spoke again.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't misconstrue my light-heartedness, dearest. It's
a habit with me, not a fault. I see the serious side to
your affair&mdash;as you view it. You have promised to
marry Vos Engo. You'll have to break that promise.
He didn't save me. Colonel Quinnox would have accomplished
it, in any event. He can't hold you to such
a silly pledge. You&mdash;you haven't by any chance told
him that you love him?&quot; He asked this in sudden
anxiety.</p>

<p>&quot;Really, Truxton, I cannot discuss&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm quite sure you haven't,&quot; he announced contentedly.
&quot;You couldn't have done that, I know. Now,
I want you to make me a promise that you'll keep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Truxton&mdash;don't ask me to say that I'll be your&mdash;&quot;
She stopped, painfully embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;That will come later,&quot; he said consolingly. &quot;I want
you to promise, on your sacred word of honour, that
you'll kiss no man until you've kissed me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she murmured, utterly speechless.</p>

<p>&quot;Promise!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I cannot promise that,&quot; she said in tones almost
inaudible. &quot;I am not sure that I'll ever&mdash;ever kiss anybody.
How silly you are!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll make exception in the case of your brother&mdash;and,
yes, the Prince.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll not make such a promise,&quot; she cried.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, I'll be hanged if I'll save you from the ridiculous
mess you've gotten yourself into,&quot; he announced
with finality. &quot;Moreover, you're not yet safe from old
Marlanx. Think it over, my&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, he cannot seize the Castle&mdash;it is impossible!&quot; she
cried in sudden terror.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so sure about that,&quot; he said laconically.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it you really want me to say?&quot; she asked,
looking up with sudden shyness in her starry eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;That you love me&mdash;and me only, Loraine,&quot; he
whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;I will not say it,&quot; she cried, breaking away from
him. &quot;But,&quot; as she ran to the steps, a delicious tremor
in her voice&mdash;&quot;I <i>will</i> consider the other thing you ask.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Darling&mdash;don't go,&quot; he cried, in eager, subdued
tones, but she already was half way across the balcony.
In a moment she was gone. &quot;Poor, harassed little
sweetheart!&quot; he murmured, with infinite tenderness. For
a long time he stood there, looking at the window
through which she had disappeared, his heart full of
song.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, he remembered the meeting. &quot;Great
Scott!&quot; in dismay. &quot;I'm late for the pow-wow.&quot; A
twisted smile stole over his face. &quot;I wonder how they've
managed to get along without me.&quot; Then he presented
himself, somewhat out of breath, to the attendants at
the south doors, where he had been directed to report. A
moment later he was in the Castle of Graustark, following
a stiff-backed soldier through medi&aelig;val halls of
marble, past the historic staircase, down to the door of
the council chamber. He was filled with the most delicious
sensation of awe and reverence. Only in his
dearest dreams had he fancied himself in these cherished
halls. And now he was there&mdash;actually treading the
same mosaic floors that had known the footsteps of
countless princes and princesses, his nostrils tingling
with the rare incense of five centuries, his blood leaping
to the call of a thousand romances. The all but mythical
halls of Graustark&mdash;the sombre, vaulted, time-defying
corridors of his fancy. Somewhere in this vast pile of
stone was the girl he loved. Each shadowy nook, each
velvety recess, seemed to glow with the wizardry of love-lamps
that had been lighted with the building of the
Castle. How many hearts had learned the wistful lesson
in these aged halls? How many loves had been
sheltered here?</p>

<p>He walked on air. He pinched himself&mdash;and even
then was not certain that he was awake. It was too
good to be true.</p>

<p>He was ushered into a large, sedately furnished room.
A score of men were there before him&mdash;sitting or standing
in attitudes of attention, listening to the words of
General Braze. King's entrance was the signal for an
immediate transfer of interest. The General bowed
most politely and at once turned to Count Halfont with
the remark that he had quite finished his suggestions.
The Prime Minister came forward to greet the momentarily
shy American. King had time to note that the
only man who denied him a smile of welcome was Count
Vos Engo. He promptly included his rival in his own
sweeping, self-conscious smile.</p>

<p>&quot;The Council has been extolling you, Mr. King,&quot; said
the Prime Minister, leading him to a seat near his own.
Truxton sat down, bewildered. &quot;We may some day
grow large enough to adequately appreciate the invaluable,
service you have performed in behalf of Graustark.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton blushed. He could think of nothing to say,
except: &quot;I'm sorry to have been so late. I was detained.&quot;</p>

<p>Involuntarily he glanced at Vos Engo. That gentleman
started, a curious light leaping into his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. King, we have asked you here for the purpose of
hearing the full story of your experiences during the
past two weeks, if you will be so good as to relate them.
We have had them piecemeal. I need not tell you that
Graustark is in the deepest peril. If there is a single
suggestion that you can make that will help her to-night,
I assure you that it will be given the most grateful
consideration. Graustark has come to know and
respect the resourcefulness and courage of the American
gentleman. We have seen him at his best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have really done no more than to&mdash;er&mdash;save my
own neck,&quot; said Truxton simply. &quot;Any one might be
excused for doing the same. Graustark owes a great
deal more to Miss Tullis than it does to me, believe me,
my lords. She had the courage, I the strength.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be assured of our attitude toward Miss Tullis,&quot; said
Halfont in reply. &quot;Graustark loves her. It can do no
more than that. It is from Miss Tullis that we have
learned the extent of your valorous achievements. Ah,
my dear young friend, she has given you a fair name.
She tells us of a miracle and we are convinced.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton stammered his remonstrances, but glowed with
joy and pride.</p>

<p>&quot;Here is the situation in a nutshell,&quot; went on the Prime
Minister. &quot;We are doomed unless succor reaches us
from the outside. We have discussed a hundred projects.
While we are inactive, Count Marlanx is gaining
more power and a greater hold over the people of the
city. We have no means of communication with Prince
Dantan of Dawsbergen, who is our friend. We seem
unable to get warning to John Tullis, who, if given
time, might succeed in collecting a sufficient force of
loyal countrymen to harass and eventually overthrow
the Dictator. Unless he is reached before long, John
Tullis and his combined force of soldiers will be ambushed
and destroyed. I am loth to speak of another
alternative that has been discussed at length by the
ministers and their friends. The Duke of Perse, from
a bed of pain and anguish, has counselled us to take
steps in the direction I am about to speak of. You see,
we are taking you into our confidence, Mr. King.</p>

<p>&quot;We can appeal to Russia in this hour of stress.
Moreover, we may expect that help will be forthcoming.
But we will have to make an unpleasant sacrifice. Russia
is eager to take over our new issue of railway bonds.
Hitherto, we have voted against disposing of the bonds
in that country, the reason being obvious. St. Petersburg
wants a new connecting line with her possessions
in Afghanistan. Our line will provide a most direct
route&mdash;a cut-off, I believe they call it. Last year the
Grand Duke Paulus volunteered to provide the money
for the construction of the line from Edelweiss north
to Balak on condition that Russia be given the right to
use the line in connection with her own roads to the
Orient. You may see the advantage in this to Russia.
Mr. King, if I send word to the Grand Duke Paulus,
agreeing to his terms, which still remain open to us,
signing away a most valuable right in what we had
hoped would be our own individual property, we have
every reason to believe that he will send armed forces
to our relief, on the pretext that Russia is defending
properties of her own. That is one way in which we
may oust Count Marlanx. The other lies in the ability
of John Tullis to give battle to him with our own people
carrying the guns. I am confident that Count Marlanx
will not bombard the Castle except as a last resort. He
will attempt to starve us into submission first; but he
will not destroy property if he can help it. I have been
as brief as possible. Lieutenant Haddan has told us
quite lately of a remark you made which he happened to
overhear. If I quote him correctly, you said to the
Englishman Hobbs that you could get away with it,
meaning, as I take it, that you could succeed in reaching
John Tullis. The remark interested me, coming as it
did from one so resourceful. May I not implore you to
tell us how you would go about it?&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton had turned a brick red. Shame and mortification
surged within him. He was cruelly conscious of an
undercurrent of irony in the Premier's courteous request.
For an instant he was sorely crushed. A low
laugh from the opposite side of the room sent a shaft
to his soul. He looked up. Vos Engo was still smiling.
In an instant the American's blood boiled; his manner
changed like a flash; blind, unreasoning bravado succeeded
embarrassment.</p>

<p>He faced Count Halfont coolly, almost impudently.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I was unfortunate enough to add that your
men were going about it&mdash;well, like amateurs,&quot; he said,
with a frank smile. &quot;I meant no offense.&quot; Then he
arose suddenly, adjusted his necktie with the utmost
<i>sang froid</i>, and announced:</p>

<p>&quot;I did say I could get to John Tullis. If you like,
I'll start to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>His words created a profound impression, they came
so abruptly. The men stared at him, then at each
other. It was as if he had read their thoughts and had
jumped at once to the conclusion that they were baiting
him. Every one began talking at once. Soon some
one began to shake his hand. Then there were cheers
and a dozen handshakings. Truxton grimly realised
that he had done just what they had expected him to do.
He tried to look unconcerned.</p>

<p>&quot;You will require a guide,&quot; said Colonel Quinnox, who
had been studying the <i>degage</i> American in the most
earnest manner.</p>

<p>&quot;Send for Mr. Hobbs, please,&quot; said Truxton.</p>

<p>A messenger was sent post haste to the barracks. The
news already was spreading throughout the Castle. The
chamber door was wide open and men were coming and
going. Eager women were peering through the doorway
for a glimpse of the American.</p>

<p>&quot;There should be three of us,&quot; said King, addressing
the men about him. &quot;One of us is sure to get away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is not a man here&mdash;or in the service&mdash;who will
not gladly accompany you, Mr. King,&quot; cried General
Braze quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;Count Vos Engo is the man I would choose, if I may
be permitted the honour of naming my companion,&quot;
said Truxton, grinning inwardly with a malicious joy.</p>

<p>Vos Engo turned a yellowish green. His eyes bulged.</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I am in command of the person of his Royal
Highness,&quot; he stammered, suddenly going very red.</p>

<p>&quot;I had forgotten your present occupation,&quot; said Truxton
quietly. &quot;Pray pardon the embarrassment I may
have caused you. After all, I think Hobbs will do.
He knows the country like a book. Besides, his business
in the city must be very dull just now. He'll be
glad to have the chance to personally conduct me for a
few days. As an American tourist, I must insist, gentlemen,
on being personally conducted by a man from
Cook's.&quot;</p>

<p>They did not know whether to laugh or to treat it as
a serious announcement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs came. That is to say, he was produced.
It is doubtful if Mr. Hobbs ever fully recovered from
the malady commonly known as stage fright. He had
never been called Mr. Hobbs by a Prime Minister before,
nor had he ever been asked in person by a Minister
of War if he had a family at home. Moreover, no assemblage
of noblemen had ever condescended to unite in
three cheers for him. Afterward Truxton King was
obliged to tell him that he had unwaveringly volunteered
to accompany him on the perilous trip to the hills. Be
sure of it, Mr. Hobbs was not in a mental condition
for many hours to even remotely comprehend what had
taken place. He only knew that he had been invited,
as an English <i>gentleman</i>, to participate in a council of
war.</p>

<p>But Mr. Hobbs was not the kind to falter, once he had
given his word; however hazy he may have been at the
moment, he knew that he had volunteered to do something.
Nor did it seem to surprise him when he finally
found out what it was.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll be off at midnight, Hobbs,&quot; said Truxton, feeling
in his pocket for the missing watch.</p>

<p>&quot;As you say, Mr. King, just as you say,&quot; said Hobbs
with fine indifference.</p>

<p>As Truxton was leaving the Castle ten minutes later,
Hobbs having gone before to see to the packing of
food-bags and the filling of flasks, a brisk, eager-faced
young attendant hurried up to him.</p>

<p>&quot;I bear a message from his Royal Highness,&quot; said the
attendant, detaining him.</p>

<p>&quot;He should be sound asleep at this time,&quot; said Truxton,
surprised.</p>

<p>&quot;His Royal Highness insists on staying awake as long
as possible, sir. It is far past his bedtime, but these
are troublesome times, he says. Every man should do
his part. Prince Robin has asked for you, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He desires you to appear before him at once, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In&mdash;in the audience chamber?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In his bedchamber, sir. He is very sleepy, but says
that you are to come to him before starting away on
your mission of danger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Plucky little beggar!&quot; cried Truxton, his heart swelling
with love for the royal youngster.</p>

<p>&quot;Sir!&quot; exclaimed the attendant, his eyes wide with
amazement and reproof.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll see him,&quot; said the other promptly, as if he were
granting the audience.</p>

<p>He followed the perplexed attendant up the grand
staircase, across thickly carpeted halls in which posed
statuesque soldiers of the Royal Guard, to the door of
the Prince's bedchamber. Here he was confronted by
Count Vos Engo.</p>

<p>&quot;Enter,&quot; said Vos Engo, with very poor grace, standing
aside. The sentinels grounded their arms and Truxton
King passed into the royal chamber, alone.</p>

<h3>BY THE WATER-GATE</h3>


<p>It was a vast, lofty apartment, regal in its subdued
lights. An enormous, golden bed with gorgeous hangings
stood far down the room. So huge was this royal
couch that Truxton at first overlooked the figure sitting
bolt upright in the middle of it. The tiny occupant
called out in a very sleepy voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Here I am, Mr. King. Gee, I hate a bed as big as
this. They just make me sleep in it.&quot;</p>

<p>An old woman advanced from the head of the couch
and motioned Truxton to approach.</p>

<p>&quot;I am deeply honoured, your Highness,&quot; said the
visitor, bowing very low. Through the windows he
could see motionless soldiers standing guard in the
balcony.</p>

<p>&quot;Come over here, Mr. King. Nurse won't let me get
up. Excuse my nighty, will you, please? I'm to have
pajamas next winter.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton advanced to the side of the bed. His eyes
had swept the room in search of the one person he
wanted most to see of all in the world. An old male
servitor was drawing the curtains at the lower end of
the room. There was no one else there, except the
nurse. They seemed as much a part of the furnishings
of this room as if they had been fixtures from the
beginning.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure you will like them,&quot; said Truxton, wondering
whether she were divinely secreted in one of the
great, heavily draped window recesses. She had been
in this room but recently. A subtle, delicate, enchanting
perfume that he had noticed earlier in the evening&mdash;ah,
he would never forget it.</p>

<p>The Prince's legs were now hanging over the edge of
the bed. His eyes were dancing with excitement; sleep
was momentarily routed.</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Mr. King, I wish I was going with you to find
Uncle Jack. You will find him, won't you? I'm going
to say it in my prayers to-night and every night. They
won't hardly let me leave this room. It's rotten luck.
I want to fight, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are all fighting for you, Prince Robin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to find Uncle Jack, Mr. King,&quot; went on
Bobby eagerly. &quot;And tell him I didn't mean it when
I banished him the other day. I really and truly didn't.&quot;
He was having difficulty in keeping back the tears.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall deliver the message, your Highness,&quot; said
Truxton, his heart going out to the unhappy youngster.
&quot;Rest assured of that, please. Go to sleep and dream
that I have found him and am bringing him back to
you. The dream will come true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; brightening perceptibly.</p>

<p>&quot;Positively.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Americans always do what they say they will,&quot; said
the boy, his eyes snapping. &quot;Here's something for you
to take with you, Mr. King. It's my lucky stone. It
always gives good luck. Of course, you must promise
to bring it back to me. It's an omen.&quot;</p>

<p>He unclasped his small fingers; in the damp palm lay
one of those peculiarly milky, half-transparent pebbles,
common the world over and of value only to small,
impressionable boys. Truxton accepted it with profound
gravity.</p>

<p>&quot;I found it last 4th of July, when we were celebrating
out there in the park. I'm always going to have a 4th
of July here. Don't you lose it, Mr. King, and you'll
have good luck. Baron Dangloss says it's the luckiest
kind of a stone. And when you come back, Mr. King,
I'm going to knight you. I'd do it now, only Aunt
Loraine says you'd be worrying about your title all the
time and might be 'stracted from your mission. I'm
going to make a baron of you. That's higher than a
count in Graustark. Vos Engo is only a count.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton started. He looked narrowly into the frank,
engaging eyes of the boy in the nighty.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be overwhelmed,&quot; he said. Then his hand went
to his mouth in the vain effort to cover the smile that
played there.</p>

<p>&quot;My mother used to say that American girls liked
titles,&quot; said the Prince with ingenuous candor.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; He hoped that she was eavesdropping.</p>

<p>&quot;Nurse said that I was not to keep you long, Mr.
King,&quot; said the Prince ruefully. &quot;I suppose you are
very busy getting ready. I just wanted to give you my
lucky stone and tell you about being a baron. I won't
have any luck till you come back. Tell Mr. Hobbs I'm
thinking of making him a count. You're awful brave,
Mr. King.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Prince Robin. May I&mdash;&quot; he glanced uneasily
at the distant nurse&mdash;&quot;may I ask how your
Aunt Loraine is feeling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She acted very funny when I sent for you. I'm worried
about her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did she do, your Highness?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She rushed off to her room. I think, Mr. King, she
was getting ready to cry or something. You see, she's
in trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In trouble?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I can't tell you about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's worried about her brother, of course&mdash;and
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just wish I could tell you&mdash;no, I won't. It wouldn't
be fair,&quot; Bobby said, checking himself resolutely. &quot;She's
awful proud of you. I'm sure she likes you, Mr. King.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm very, very glad to hear that.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobby had great difficulty in keeping his most secret
impressions to himself. In fact, he floundered painfully
in an attack on diplomacy.</p>

<p>&quot;You should have seen her when Uncle Caspar came
in to say you were going off to find her brother. She
cried. Yes, sir, she did. She kissed me and&mdash;but you
don't like to hear silly things about girls, do you? Great
big men never do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard enough to make me want to do something
very silly myself,&quot; said Truxton, radiant. &quot;I&mdash;I don't
suppose I could&mdash;er&mdash;see your Aunt Loraine for a
few minutes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think not. She said she just&mdash;now, you mustn't
mind her, Mr. King&mdash;she just couldn't bear it, that's
all. She told me to say she'd pray for you and&mdash;Oh,
Mr. King, I do hope she won't marry that other man!&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton bent his knee. &quot;Your Highness, as it seems
I am not to see her, and as you seem to be the very best
friend I have, I should very much like to ask a great
favour of you. Will you take this old ring of mine
and wish it on her finger just as soon as I have left
your presence?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you know she was coming in again?&quot; in
wide-eyed wonder. &quot;Excuse me. I shouldn't ask questions.
What shall I wish?&quot; It was the old ring that
had come from Spantz's shop. The Prince promptly hid
it beneath the pillow.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll leave that to you, my best of friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet it'll be a good wish, all right. I know what to
wish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you do. Would you mind giving her something
else from me?&quot; He hesitated before venturing the
second request. Then, overswept by a warm, sweet impulse,
he stepped forward, took the boy's face between
his eager hands, and pressed a kiss upon his forehead.
&quot;Give her that for me, will you, Prince Robin Goodfellow.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobby beamed. &quot;But I never kiss her <i>there!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be ten thousand times obliged, your Highness,
if you will deliver it in the usual place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do it!&quot; almost shouted the Prince. Then he
clapped his hand over his mouth and looked, pop-eyed
with apprehension, toward the nurse.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, good-bye and God bless you,&quot; said Truxton.
&quot;I must be off. Your Uncle Jack is waiting for me, up
there in the hills.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobby's eyes filled with tears. &quot;Oh, Mr. King, please
give him my love and make him hurry back. I&mdash;I need
him awful!&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton found Mr. Hobbs in a state bordering on
collapse.</p>

<p>&quot;I say, Mr. King, it's all right to say we'll go, but
how the deuce are we to do it? My word, there's no more
chance of getting out of the&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, Hobbs: we're going to swim out,&quot; said Truxton.
He was engaged in stuffing food into a knapsack.
Colonel Quinnox and Haddan had been listening to
Hobbs's lamentations for half an hour, in King's room.</p>

<p>&quot;Swim? Oh, I say! By hokey, he's gone clean daffy!&quot;
Hobbs was eyeing him with alarm. The others looked
hard at the speaker, scenting a joke.</p>

<p>&quot;Not yet, Hobbs. Later on, perhaps. I had occasion
to make a short tour of investigation this afternoon.
Doubtless, gentlemen, you know where the water-gate
is, back of the Castle. Well, I've looked it over&mdash;and
under, I might say. Hobbs, you and I will sneak under
those slippery old gates like a couple of eels. I forgot
to ask if you can swim.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure I can. <i>Under</i> the gates? My word!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Simple as rolling off a log,&quot; said Truxton carelessly.
&quot;The Cascades and Basin of Venus run out through the
gate. There is a space of at least a foot below the
bottom of the gate, which hasn't been opened in fifty
years, I'm told. A good swimmer can wriggle through,
d'ye see? That lets him out into the little canal that
connects with the river. Then&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see!&quot; cried Quinnox. &quot;It can be done! No one will
be watching at that point.&quot;</p>

<p>The sky was overcast, the night as black as ebony.
The four men left the officers' quarters at one o'clock,
making their way to the historic old gate in the glen
below the Castle. Arriving at the wall, Truxton briefly
whispered his plans.</p>

<p>&quot;You remember, Colonel Quinnox, that the stream is
four or five feet deep here at the gate. The current
has washed a deeper channel under the iron-bound
timbers. The gates are perhaps two feet thick. For
something like seven or eight feet from the bottom they
are so constructed that the water runs through an open
network of great iron bars. Now, Hobbs and I will go
under the gates in the old-clothes you have given us.
When we are on the opposite side we'll stick close by the
gate, and you may pass our dry clothes out between the
bars above the surface of the water. Our guns, the
map and the food, as well. It's very simple. Then we'll
drop down the canal a short distance and change our
clothes in the underbrush. Hobbs knows where we can
procure horses and he knows a trusty guide on the other
side of the city. So long, Colonel. I'll see you later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God be with you,&quot; said Quinnox fervently. The four
men shook hands and King slipped into the water without
a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>&quot;Right after me, Hobbs,&quot; he said, and then his head
went under.</p>

<p>A minute later he and Hobbs were on the outside of the
gate, gasping for breath. Standing in water to their
necks, Quinnox and Haddan passed the equipment
through the barred openings. There were whispered
good-byes and then two invisible heads bobbed off in the
night, wading in the swift-flowing canal, up to their
chins. Swimming would have been dangerous, on
account of the noise.</p>

<p>Holding their belongings high above their heads, with
their hearts in their mouths, King and the Englishman
felt their way carefully along the bed of the stream.
Not a sound was to be heard, except the barking of dogs
in the distance. The stillness of death hung over the
land. So still, that the almost imperceptible sounds they
made in breathing and moving seemed like great volumes
of noise in their tense ears.</p>

<p>A hundred yards from the gate they crawled ashore
and made their way up over the steep bank into the
thick, wild underbrush. Not a word had been spoken
up to this time.</p>

<p>&quot;Quietly now, Hobbs. Let us get out of these duds.
'Gad, they're like ice. From now on, Hobbs, you lead
the way. I'll do my customary act of following.&quot;</p>

<p>Hobbs was shivering from the cold. &quot;I say, Mr. King,
you're a wonder, that's wot you are. Think of going
under those bally gates!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, Hobbs, think of it, but don't talk.&quot;</p>

<p>They stealthily stripped themselves of the wet garments,
and, after no end of trouble, succeeded in getting
into the dry substitutes. Then they lowered the wet
bundles into the water and quietly stole off through the
brush, Hobbs in the lead, intent upon striking the King's
Highway, a mile or two above town. It was slow, arduous
going, because of the extreme caution required. A
wide detour was made by the canny Hobbs&mdash;wider, in
fact, than the impatient American thought wholly necessary.
In time, however, they came to the Highway.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we've got a start, Hobbs. We'll win out, just
as I said we would. Easy as falling off a log.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so blooming sure of that,&quot; said Hobbs. He
was recalling a recent flight along this very road.
&quot;We're a long way from being out of the woods.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be a kill-joy, Hobbs. Look at the bright side
of things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do that in the morning, when the sun's up,&quot; said
Hobbs, with a sigh. &quot;Come along, sir. We take this
path here for the upper road. It's a good two hours'
walk up the mountain to Rabot's, where we get the
horses.&quot;</p>

<p>All the way up the black, narrow mountain path
Hobbs kept the lead. King followed, his thoughts divided
between the blackness ahead and the single, steady
light in a certain window now far behind. He had seen
the lighted window in the upper balcony as he passed the
Castle on the way to the gate. Somehow he knew she
was there saying good-bye and Godspeed to him.</p>

<p>At four o'clock, as the sun reached up with his long,
red fingers from behind the Monastery mountain, Truxton
King and Hobbs rode away from Rabot's cottage
high in the hills, refreshed and sound of heart. Rabot's
son rode with them, a sturdy, loyal lad, who had leaped
joyously at the chance to serve his Prince. Undisturbed,
they rode straight for the passes below St. Valentine's.
Behind and below them lay the sleeping, restless, unhappy
city of Edelweiss, with closed gates and unfriendly,
sullen walls. There reigned the darkest fiend
that Graustark, in all her history, had ever come to
know.</p>

<p>Truxton King had slipped through his fingers with
almost ridiculous ease. So simple had it been, that the
two messengers, gloating in the prospect ahead, now
spoke of the experience as if it were the most trivial
thing in their lives. They mentioned it casually; that
was all.</p>

<p>Now, let us turn to John Tullis and his quest in the
hills. It goes without saying that he found no trace of
his sister or her abductors. For five days he scoured the
lonely, mysterious mountains, dragging the tired but
loyal hundred about at his heels, distracted by fear and
anguish over the possible fate of the adored one. On
the fifth day, a large force of Dawsbergen soldiers, led
by Prince Dantan himself, found the fagged, disspirited
American and his half-starved men encamped in a rocky
defile in the heart of the wilderness.</p>

<p>That same night a Graustark mountaineer passed the
sentinels and brought news of the disturbance in Edelweiss.
He could give no details. He only knew that
there had been serious rioting in the streets and that
the gates were closed against all comers. He could not
tell whether the rioters&mdash;most of whom he took to be
strikers, had been subdued or whether mob-law prevailed.
He had been asked to cast his lot with the strikers, but
had refused. For this he was driven away from his home,
which was burned. His wife and child were now at the
Monastery, where many persons had taken refuge.</p>

<p>In a flash it occurred to John Tullis that Marlanx was
at the bottom of this deviltry. The abduction of
Loraine was a part of his plan! Prince Dantan advised
a speedy return to the city. His men were at the
command of the American. Moreover, the Prince himself
decided to accompany the troops.</p>

<p>Before sunrise, the command, now five or six hundred
strong, was picking its way down the dangerous mountain
roads toward the main highway. Fifteen miles below
Edelweiss they came upon the company of soldiers
sent out to preserve order in the railroad camps.</p>

<p>The officer in charge exhibited a document, given under
the hand and seal of Baron Dangloss, directing him to
remain in command of the camps until the strikers, who
were unruly, could be induced to resume work once more.
This order, of course, was a forgery, designed to mislead
the little force until Marlanx saw fit to expose his
hand to the world. It had come by messenger on the
very day of the rioting. The messenger brought the
casual word that the government was arresting and
punishing the lawless, and that complete order would
hardly be established for several days at the outside.
He went so far as to admit that an attempt on the life
of the Prince had failed. Other reports had come to
the camps, and all had been to the effect that the rioting
was over. The strikers, it seemed, were coming to terms
with their employers and would soon take up the work of
construction once more. All this sufficed to keep the
real situation from reaching the notice of the young
captain; he was obeying orders and awaiting the return
of the workmen.</p>

<p>The relief that swept into the souls of the newly arrived
company was short-lived. They had gone into
camp, tired, sore and hungry, and were preparing to
take a long needed rest before taking up the last stage
of their march toward the city. John Tullis was now in
feverish haste to reach the city, where at least he might
find a communication from the miscreants, demanding
ransom. He had made up his mind to pay whatever
they asked. Down in his heart, however, there was a
restless fear that she had not fallen into the hands of
ordinary bandits. He could not banish the sickening
dread that she was in the power of Marlanx, to whom
she alone could pay the ransom exacted.</p>

<p>Hardly had the men thrown themselves from their
horses when the sound of shooting in the distance struck
their ears. Instantly the entire force was alert. A dozen
shots were fired in rapid succession; then single reports
far apart. The steady beat of horses' feet was now
plain to the attentive company. There was a quick,
incisive call to arms; a squad stood ready for action.
The clatter of hoofs drew nearer; a small group of
horsemen came thundering down the defile. Three
minutes after the firing was first heard, sentries threw
their rifles to their shoulders and blocked the approach
of the riders.</p>

<p>A wild, glad shout went up from the foremost horseman.
He had pulled his beast to its haunches almost
at the muzzles of the guns.</p>

<p>&quot;Tullis!&quot; he shouted, waving his hat.</p>

<p>John Tullis ran toward the excited group in the road.
He saw three men, one of whom was shouting his name
with all the power in his lungs.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God, we've found you!&quot; cried the horseman,
swinging to the ground despite the proximity of strange
rifles. &quot;Put up your guns! We're friends!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;King!&quot; exclaimed Tullis, suddenly recognising him.
A moment later they were clasping hands.</p>

<p>&quot;This is luck! We find you almost as soon as we set
out to do so. Glory be! You've got a fair-sized army,
too. We'll need 'em&mdash;and more.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What has happened, King? Where have you been?
We looked for you after your disap&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's ancient history,&quot; interrupted the other. &quot;How
soon can you get these troops on the march? There's
not a moment to be lost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good God, man, tell me what it is&mdash;what has happened?
The Prince? What of him?&quot; cried Tullis,
grasping King's arm in the clutch of a vise.</p>

<p>&quot;He sends his love and rescinds the order of exile,&quot;
said King, smiling. Then seriously: &quot;Marlanx has
taken the city. It was all a game, this getting rid of
you. He's superstitious about Americans. There was
bomb-throwing in the square and a massacre afterward.
The Prince and all the others are besieged in the Castle.
I'll tell you all about it. Hobbs and I are the only men
who have got away from the Castle alive. We left
last night. Our object was to warn you in time to prevent
an ambush. You've got to save the throne for
Prince Robin. I'll explain as we go along. I may as
well inform you right now that there's a big force of
men waiting for you in the ravine this side of the
Monastery. We saw them. Thank God, we got to you
in time. You can now take 'em by surprise and&mdash;whiff!
They'll run like dogs. Back here a couple of miles
we came upon a small gang of real robbers. We had a
bit of shooting and&mdash;I regret to say&mdash;no one was
bagged. I'd advise you to have this force pushed along
as rapidly as possible. I have a message from your
sister, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Loraine? Where is she, King?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't tremble like that, old man. She's safe enough&mdash;in
the Castle. Oh, it was a fine game Marlanx had
in his mind.&quot;</p>

<p>While the troopers were making ready for the march,
Truxton King and Hobbs related their story to eager,
horrified groups of officers. It may be well to say that
neither said more of his own exploits than was absolutely
necessary to connect the series of incidents. Prince
Dantan marvelled anew at this fresh demonstration of
Yankee courage and ingenuity. King graphically narrated
the tale from beginning to end. The full force
of the amazing tragedy was brought home to the pale,
half-dazed listeners. There were groans and curses and
bitter cries of vengeance. John Tullis was crushed;
despair was written in his face, anguish in his eyes.</p>

<p>What was to become of the Prince?</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, Tullis, we must destroy these scoundrels
who are lying in wait for you in the ravine,&quot; said Prince
Dantan. &quot;After that you can be in a position to breathe
easily while collecting the army of fighters that Mr.
King suggests. Surely, you will be able to raise a large
and determined force. My men are at Prince Robin's
disposal. Captain Haas may command them as his
own. I deplore the fact that I may not call upon the
entire Dawsbergen army. Marlanx evidently knows our
laws. Our army cannot go to the aid of a neighbor.
We have done so twice in half a century and our people
have been obliged to pay enormous indemnity. But
there are men here. I am here. We will not turn back,
Mr. Tullis. My people will not hold me at fault for
taking a hand in this. I shall send messengers to the
Princess; she, of course, must know.&quot;</p>

<p>The battalion, augmented by the misguided company
from the deserted railroad camps, moved swiftly into the
defile, led by young Rabot. Truxton King rode beside
the brother of the girl he loved, uttering words of cheer
and encouragement.</p>

<p>&quot;King, you <i>do</i> put new courage into me. You are
surcharged with hope and confidence. By heaven, I believe
we can drive out that damned beast and his dogs.
We <i>will</i> do it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a chap named Brutus. I ask special permission
to kill him. That's the only request I have to
make.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I very strongly oppose the appeal to Grand Duke
Paulus. We must act decisively before that alternative
is forced upon the unhappy Halfont. It was Perse's
scheme, months ago. Perse! Confound him, I believe
he has worked all along to aid&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on, Tullis,&quot; interrupted King soberly. &quot;I
wouldn't say that if I were you. The Duke was wounded
by the dynamiters and I understand he lies on his bed
and curses Marlanx from morning till night. He prays
constantly that his daughter may be freed from the old
scoundrel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Countess Ingomede&mdash;has anything been heard
from her?&quot; asked Tullis. He had been thinking of her
for days&mdash;and nights.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, nothing definite,&quot; said King evasively. He was
reminded at this moment of his own love affair. Seized
by the boldest impulse that had ever come to him, he
suddenly blurted out: &quot;Tullis, I love your sister. I
have loved her from the beginning. All that has happened
in the last week has strengthened my adoration.
I think she cares for me, but,&mdash;but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Mr. King, I'm sorry&mdash;&quot; began Tullis,
genuinely surprised.</p>

<p>&quot;But it seems that she's promised to marry Vos Engo.
I'll tell you how it happened.&quot; Then he related the
episode of the rout in Castle Avenue. &quot;It's all wrong
for her to marry that chap. If she hasn't been bullied
into it before we get back to her, I'd like to know if
you won't put a stop to his damned impudence. What
right has such a fellow as Vos Engo to a good American
girl like Loraine? None whatever. Besides, I'm going
to fight him when we're through fighting Marlanx. I
want you as my second. Can't say whether it will be
swords, pistols or knuckles. I hope you'll oblige me.
As a matter of fact, I had two primary objects in looking
you up out here in the hills. First, to ask you for
Loraine; second, to engage you as my second.&quot;</p>

<p>Tullis was silent for a while. Then he said, quite
seriously: &quot;King, I have looked with some favour upon
Vos Engo. I thought she liked him. He isn't a bad
fellow, believe me. I want Loraine to be happy. As
for this promise to him, I'll talk that over with her&mdash;if
God permits me to see her again I shall allow her
to choose, King. You or Vos Engo&mdash;the one she loves,
that's all. As for seconding you, I am at your service.&quot;</p>

<p>King beamed. &quot;That means, I take it, that you want
me to win at least one of the contests. Well,&quot; with his
whimsical, irresistible smile, &quot;it won't be necessary to
try for the other if Vos Engo shoots me in this one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will never know the extent of my gratitude,
King. You have saved her from a hellish fate. I shall
be disappointed in her if she does not choose you. I
owe you a debt of gratitude almost as great for saving
that dear little boy of&mdash;ours. I shall not forget what
you have done&mdash;never!&quot;</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the force under Captain Haas
was divided into three companies, for strategic purposes.
The plan to surprise and defeat the skulkers in the ravine
had been carefully thought out. Two strong companies
struck off into the hills; the third and weakest of
the trio kept the road, apparently marching straight
into the trap. Signals had been arranged. At a given
sign the three parties were to swoop down upon the
position held by the enemy.</p>

<p>Several hours passed. The troop in the highroad prepared
to camp just below the treacherous pass in which
the ambush was known to be laid. Scouts had located
the confident rascals in the ravines above the highway.
With the news that their prey was approaching, they
were being rapidly rushed into position at the head of
the pass.</p>

<p>Shortly before sunset the troop in the road began to
advance, riding resolutely into the ravine. Even as
the gloating, excited desperadoes prepared to open fire
from their hidden position at the head of the pass, their
pickets came running in with the word that two large
forces were drawing in on them from the north and
east.</p>

<p>The trappers were trapped. They realised that they
had been out-generalled, and they understood their deficiencies.
Not a man among them knew the finer points
of warfare. They were thugs and roustabouts and ill-omened
fellows who could stab in the back; they were
craven in the face of an open peril.</p>

<p>There were few shots fired. The men in ambuscade
tried to escape to the fastnesses of the hills. Some of
them stood ground and fought, only to be mown down
by the enemy; others were surrounded and made captive;
but few actually succeeded in evading the troopers. All
were ready to sue for mercy and to proclaim their
willingness to divert allegiance from dictator to Crown.
Herded like so many cattle, guarded like wolves, they
were driven city-ward, few if any of them exhibiting the
slightest symptom of regret or discomfiture. In fact,
they seemed more than philosophic: they were most
jovial. These were soldiers of fortune, in the plainest
sense. It mattered little with whom they were allied or
against whom they fought, so long as the pay was
adequate and prompt.</p>

<p>Indeed, the leaders of the party&mdash;officers by grace of
lucky tosses&mdash;benignly proffered the services of themselves
and men in the movement to displace Count
Marlanx!</p>

<p>&quot;He cannot hold out,&quot; said the evil-faced captain in
cool derision. &quot;He cannot keep his promises to us. So
why should we cut our own throats? All we ask is transportation
to Austria after the job's over. That's where
most of us came from, your Excellencies. Count on us,
if you need us. Down with Marlanx!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Long live Prince&mdash;&quot; Three-fourths of them stopped
there because they did not even know the name of the
little ruler.</p>

<h3>THE RETURN</h3>


<p>From the highlands below the Monastery, Captain Haas
and his men were able to study the situation in the city.
The impracticability of an assault on any one of the
stubborn, well-guarded gates was at once recognised. A
force of seven hundred men, no matter how well trained
or determined, could not be expected to surmount walls
that had often withstood the attack of as many thousands.
The wisdom of delaying until a few thousand
loyal, though poorly armed countrymen could be
brought into play against the city appealed at once to
Prince Dantan and John Tullis.</p>

<p>Withdrawing to an unexposed cut in the hills, safe
from the shells that might be thrown up from the
fortress, they established their camps, strongly entrenched
and practically invulnerable against any attack
from below. Squads of men were sent without delay
into the hills and valleys to call the panic-stricken,
wavering farmers into the fold. John Tullis headed the
company that struck off into the well-populated Ganlook
district.</p>

<p>Marlanx, as if realising the nature of the movement in
the hills, began a furious assault on the gates leading to
the Castle. The watchers in the hills could see as well
as hear the conflict that raged almost at their feet, so
to speak. They cheered like mad when the motley army
of the usurper was frustrated in the attempt to take the
main gates. From the walls about the park, Quinnox's
men, few as they were, sent such deadly volleys into the
streets below that the hordes fell back and found shelter
behind the homes of the rich. With half an eye, one
could see that the rascals were looting the palaces, secure
from any opposition on the part of the government
forces; through the glasses, scattered crowds of men
could be seen carrying articles from the houses; more
than one of the mansions went up in flames as the day
grew old and the lust of the pillagers increased.</p>

<p>The next morning, Captain Haas announced to his
followers that Marlanx had begun to shell the Castle.
Big guns in the fortress were hurling great shells over
the city, dropping them in the park. On the other hand,
Colonel Quinnox during the night had swung three
Gatling guns to the top of the wall; they were stationed
at intervals along the wall, commanding every point
from which an assault might be expected. It was a
well-known fact that there was no heavy ordnance at
the Castle. All day long, Marlanx's men, stationed in
the upper stories of houses close to the walls, kept up a
constant rifle fire, their bullets being directed against the
distant windows of the Castle. That this desultory
fusillade met with scant response at the hands of Quinnox,
was quite apparent to the uneasy, champing
watchers near the Monastery.</p>

<p>&quot;Marlanx will not begin the actual bombardment until
he knows that Tullis is drawing together a formidable
force,&quot; prophesied Prince Dantan.</p>

<p>&quot;But when he does begin the real shelling,&quot; mourned
Truxton King, chafing like a lion under the deadly inaction.
&quot;I can't bear the thought of what it means to
those inside the Castle. He can blow it to pieces over
their heads. Then, from the house tops, he can pick
them off like blackbirds. It's awful! Is there nothing
that we can do, Prince? Damn it all, I know we can
force a gate. And if we once get in where those
cowardly dogs are lording it, you'll see 'em take the walls
like steeple-chasers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Mr. King,&quot; said Prince Dantan calmly,
&quot;you don't know Colonel Quinnox and the House Guard.
The Quinnoxs have guarded Graustark's rulers for I
don't know how many generations. History does not
go back so far, I fear. You may depend on it, there
will be no living guardsmen inside those walls when
Marlanx lays his hands on the Prince.&quot;</p>

<p>That night recruits from the farms and villages began
to straggle into the camp. They were armed with
rifles, ordinary shotguns and antique &quot;blunderbusses;&quot;
swords, staves and aged lances. All were willing to die
in the service of the little Prince; all they needed was a
determined, capable leader to rally them from the state
of utter panic. They reported that the Crown foragers
might expect cheerful and plenteous tribute from
the farmers and stock growers. Only the mountaineers
were hostile.</p>

<p>The army now grew with astonishing rapidity. The
recruits were not fighting men in a military sense, but
their hearts were true and they hungered for the chance
to stamp out the evil that lay at their feet. By the
close of the second day nearly three thousand men were
encamped above the city. Late that night John Tullis
rode into camp at the head of a great company from
the Ganlook province. He had retaken the town of
Ganlook, seized the fortress, and recruited the entire
fighting strength of the neighbourhood. More than
that, he had unlimbered and conveyed to the provisional
camp two of the big guns that stood above the gates at
the fortress. There had been a dozen skirmishes between
the regulars and roving bands of desperadoes.
A savage fight took place at Ganlook and another in the
gap below the witch's hut. In both of these sanguinary
affrays the government forces had come off victorious,
splendid omens that did not fail to put confidence into
the hearts of the men.</p>

<p>Marlanx trained two of his big guns on the camp in
the hills. From the fortress he threw many futile shells
toward their place of shelter. They did no damage;
instead of death, they brought only laughter to the
scornful camp. Under cover of night, the two Ganlook
cannons were planted in a position commanding the
southeastern city gate. It was the plan of the new besiegers
to bombard this gate, tearing it to pieces with
shot. When their force was strong enough offensively,
an assault would be flung against this opening. Drill
and discipline were necessary, however, before the attempt
could be made. In the present chaotic, untrained
condition of their forces, an assault would prove not
only ineffectual, but disastrous. Day after day the
recruits were put through hard drill under the direction
of the regular officers. Every day saw the force increased.
This made hard work for the drill-masters.
The willingness of the recruits, however, lessened the
task considerably.</p>

<p>The knowledge that Marlanx had no big guns except
those stationed in the fortress was most consoling to
Tullis and his friends. He could not destroy the Castle
gates with shells, except by purest chance. He could
drop shells into the Castle, but to hit a gate twenty feet
wide? Never! Field ordnance was unknown to this
country of mountains.</p>

<p>The Iron Count's inability to destroy the Castle gates
made it feasible for the men in the hills to devote
considerable more time to drill and preparation than they
might have sacrificed if the conditions were the reverse.
They were confident that Quinnox could hold the Castle
for many days. With all this in mind, Captain Haas
and Prince Dantan beat down the objections of the impatient
Americans; the work of preparation against
ignominous failure went on as rapidly as possible. Haas
would not attack until he was ready, or it became absolutely
certain that the men at the Castle were in dire
need.</p>

<p>Signalling between the Castle and the hills had been
going on for days. The absence of the &quot;wigwag&quot; system
made it impossible to convey intelligible messages.</p>

<p>Truxton King was growing haggard from worry and
loss of sleep. He could not understand the abominable,
criminal procrastination. He was of a race that did
things with a dash and on the spur of the moment. His
soul sickened day by day. John Tullis, equally unhappy,
but more philosophical, often found him seated upon a
rock at the top of the ravine, an unlighted pipe in his
fingers, his eyes intent upon the hazy Castle.</p>

<p>&quot;Cheer up, King. Our time will come,&quot; he was wont
to say.</p>

<p>&quot;I've just got to do something, Tullis. This standing
around is killing me.&quot; Again he would respond: &quot;Don't
forget that I love some one down there, old man. Maybe
she's worrying about me, as well as about you.&quot; Once
he gave poor Mr. Hobbs a frightful tongue-lashing and
was afterward most contrite and apologetic. Poor
Hobbs had been guilty of asking if he had a headache.</p>

<p>Truxton was assigned to several scouting expeditions,
simply to provide him with action and diverting excitement.
One of these expeditions determined the impossibility
of entering the city through the railroad yards
because of the trestle-work and the barricade of freight
cars at the gap in the wall.</p>

<p>They had been in camp for a week. The stategists had
practically decided that the assault could be made within
a day or two. All was in readiness&mdash;or as near as it
could be&mdash;and all was enthusiasm and excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;If Haas puts it off another day I'm going to start a
round robin, whatever that is,&quot; said Truxton. As he
said it to a Dawsbergen officer who could not understand
English, it is doubtful if that gentleman's polite nod of
acquiescence meant unqualified approval of the project.</p>

<p>At first they had built no fires at night. Now the force
was so formidable that this precaution was unnecessary.
The air was chill and there were tents for but a few of
the troopers. The fires in the ravine always were surrounded
by great circles of men, eagerly discussing the
coming battle. At the upper end of the ravine were the
tents of the officers, Prince Dantan and John Tullis.
The latter shared his with King and Mr. Hobbs. Up
here, the circle about the kindly pile of burning logs
was small, select and less demonstrative. Here they
smoked in silence most of the time, each man's thoughts
delivered to himself.</p>

<p>Above, on the jutting rock, sat the disconsolate, lovesick
Truxton. It was the night before the proposed
assault on the gates. The guns were in position and the
cannonading was to begin at daybreak. He was full
of the bitterness of doubt and misgiving. Was she in
love with Vos Engo? Was the Count's suit progressing
favourably under the fire of the enemy? Was his undoubted
bravery having its effect upon the wavering
susceptibilities of the distressed Loraine?</p>

<p>Here was he, Truxton King, idle and useless for more
than a week, beyond range of the guns of the foe, while
down there was Vos Engo in the thick of it, at the side
of the girl he loved in those long hours of peril, able
to comfort her, to cheer her, to fight for her. It was
maddening. He was sick with uncertainty, consumed by
jealousy. His pipe was not out now: he was smoking
furiously.</p>

<p>The sound of a voice in sharp command attracted his
attention. One of the sentries in the road below the
elbow of the ridge had stopped some one who was approaching
the camp. There was a bright moon, and
Truxton could see other pickets hurrying to join the
first. A few moments later the trespassers were escorted
through the lines and taken directly to headquarters. A
man and two women, King observed. Somewhat interested,
he sauntered down from his lonely boulder and
joined the group of officers.</p>

<p>John Tullis was staring hard at the group approaching
from the roadway. They were still outside the circle of
light, but it was plain to all that the newcomers were
peasants. The women wore the short red skirts and the
pointed bonnets of the lower classes. Gaudy shawls
covered their shoulders. One was tall and slender, with
a bearing that was not peasant-like. It was she who
held Tullis's intense, unbelieving gaze until they were
well inside the fire-light. She walked ahead of her
companions. Suddenly he sprang forward with a cry of
amazement.</p>

<p>It was the Countess Ingomede.</p>

<p>Her arrival created a sensation. In a moment she was
in the centre of an amazed circle of men. Tullis, after
his first low, eager greeting at the edge of the fire
circle, drew her near to the warmth-giving flames. Prince
Dantan and Captain Haas threw rugs and blankets in a
great heap for her to sit upon. Every one was talking
at once. The Countess was smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>&quot;Make room for my maid and her father. They are
colder and more fatigued than I,&quot; she said, lifting her
tired, glorious eyes to John Tullis, who stood beside her.
&quot;We have come from Balak. They suffered much, that
I might enjoy the slender comforts I was so ready to
share with them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God, you are here,&quot; he said in low, intense
tones. She could not mistake the fervour in his voice
nor the glow in his eyes. Her wondrous, yellowish orbs
looked steadily into his, and he was satisfied. They paid
tribute to the emotion that moved him to the depths of
his being. Love leaped up to him from those sweet,
tired eyes; leaped with the unerring force of an electric
current that finds its lodestone in spite of mortal will.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew you were here, John. I am not going back
to Count Marlanx. It is ended.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew it would come, Ingomede. You will let me
tell you how glad I am&mdash;some day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some day, when I am truly, wholly free from him,
John. I know what you will say, and I think you know
what I shall say in reply.&quot; Both understood and were
exalted. No other word passed between them touching
upon the thing that was uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>Food was provided for the wayfarers, and Tullis's tent
was made ready for the Countess and her maid.</p>

<p>&quot;Truxton,&quot; said he, &quot;we will have to find other quarters
for the night. I've let my apartment&mdash;furnished.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's gloriously beautiful, John,&quot; was all that Truxton
said, puffing moodily at his pipe. He was thinking
of one more beautiful, however. &quot;I suppose you'd think
it a favour if I'd pot Marlanx for you to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter whether he's potted or not, my friend.
She will not go back to him. He will have to find another
prisoner for his household.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton's thoughts went with a shudder to the underground
room and the fair prisoner who had shared it
with him. The dread of what might have been the
fate of Loraine Tullis&mdash;or what might still be in store
for her&mdash;brought cold chills over him. He abruptly
turned away and sat down at the outer edge of the
group.</p>

<p>The Countess's story was soon told. Sitting before the
great fire, surrounded by eager listeners, she related her
experiences. Prince Dantan was her most attentive
listener.</p>

<p>She had been seized on the night of the ball as she
started across her father's garden. Before sunrise she
was well on her way to Balak, in charge of three of the
Count's most faithful henchmen. As for the messages
that were sent to Edelweiss, she knew nothing of them,
except the last, which she had managed to get through
with the assistance of Josepha's father. She was kept
a close prisoner in a house just outside of Balak, and
came to learn all of the infamous projects of her
husband. At the end of ten days her maid was sent to
her from Edelweiss. She brought the news of the
calamity that had befallen the city. It was then that
she determined to break away from her captors and try
to reach the Monastery of St. Valentine, where protection
would be afforded her for the time being. After
several days of ardent persuasion, she and Josepha prevailed
upon the latter's father to assist them in their
flight. Not only was he persuaded, but in the end he
journeyed with them through the wildest country north
of Ganlook. They were four days in covering the
distance, partly on foot, partly by horse. Near the
city they heard of the presence of troops near the
Monastery. Farmers' wives told them of the newly
formed army and of its leaders. She determined to make
her way to the camp of those who would destroy her
husband, eager to give them any assistance that her own
knowledge of Marlanx's plans might provide.</p>

<p>Many details are omitted in this brief recital of her
story. Perhaps it is well to leave something to the
imagination.</p>

<p>One bit of information she gave created no end of
consternation among the would-be deliverers of the city.
It had the effect of making them all the more resolute;
the absolute necessity for immediately regaining control
in the city was forced upon them. She told them that
Count Marlanx had lately received word that the Grand
Duke Paulus was likely to intervene before many days,
acting on his own initiative, in the belief that he could
force the government of Graustark to grant the railway
privileges so much desired by his country. Marlanx
realised that he would have to forestall the wily Grand
Duke. If he were in absolute control of the Graustark
government when the Russian appeared, he and he alone
would be in a position to deal with the situation. Unless
the Castle fell into his hands beforehand, insuring the
fall of the royal house and the ministry, the Grand
Duke's natural inclination would be to first befriend the
hapless Prince and then to demand recompense in whatsoever
form he saw fit.</p>

<p>&quot;The Grand Duke may send a large force of men across
the border at any time,&quot; said the Countess in conclusion.
&quot;Count Marlanx is sure to make a decisive assault
as soon as he hears that the movement has begun. He
had hopes of starving them out, thus saving the Castle
from destruction, but as that seems unlikely, his shells
will soon begin to rain in earnest upon the dear old pile.&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton King was listening with wide open ears. As
she finished this dreary prediction he silently arose to
his feet and, without a word to any one, stalked off in
the darkness. Tullis looked after him and shook his
head sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be happy on that fellow's account when daybreak
comes and we are really at it,&quot; he said to Prince Dantan,
who knew something of King's affliction.</p>

<p>But Truxton King was not there at daybreak. When
he strode out of the camp that night, he left it behind
forever.</p>

<p>The unfortunate lack of means to communicate with the
occupants of the Castle had been the source of great
distress to Captain Haas. If the defenders could be informed
as to the exact hour of the assault from the outside,
they could do much toward its speedy success by
making a fierce sortie from behind their own walls. A
quick dash from the Castle grounds would serve to draw
Marlanx's attention in that direction, diminishing the
force that he would send to check the onslaught at the
gates. But there was no means of getting word to
Colonel Quinnox. His two or three hundred men would
be practically useless at the most critical period of the
demonstration.</p>

<p>Truxton King had all this in mind as he swung off
down the mountain road, having stolen past the sentries
with comparative ease. He was smiling to himself. If
all went well with him, Colonel Quinnox would be able
to rise to the occasion. If he failed in the daring mission
he had elected to perform, the only resulting harm would
be to himself; the plans of the besiegers would not suffer.</p>

<p>He knew his ground well by this time. He had studied
it thoroughly from the forlorn boulder at the top of the
ravine. By skirting the upper walls, on the mountain
side, he might, in a reasonably short space of time, reach
the low woodlands north of the Castle walls. The danger
from Marlanx's scouts outside the city was not great;
they had been scattered and beaten by Haas's recruiting
parties. He stood in more danger from the men he would
help, they who were the watchful defenders of the Castle.</p>

<p>It must have been two o'clock when he crossed the
King's Highway, a mile or more above the northern
gates, and struck down into the same thick undergrowth
that had protected him and Hobbs on a memorable
night not long before.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, a dripping figure threw up his hands
obligingly and laughed with exultation when confronted
by a startled guardsman <i>inside</i> the Castle walls and not
more than fifty yards from the water gates!</p>

<p>He had timed his entrance by the sound of the guardsman's
footstep on the stone protecting wall that lined
the little stream. When he came to the surface inside
the water gate, the sentry was at the extreme end of his
beat. He shouted a friendly cry as he advanced toward
the man, calling out his own name.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was standing in the presence of
the haggard, nerve-racked Quinnox, pouring into his
astonished ears the news of the coming attack. While
he was discarding his wet clothing for others, preparations
for the sortie were getting under way. The Colonel
lost no time in routing out the sleeping guardsmen and
reserves, and in sending commands to those already on
duty at the gates. The quick rattle of arms, the rush
of feet, the low cries of relief, the rousing of horses,
soon usurped the place of dreary, deadly calm.</p>

<p>When the sun peeped over the lofty hills, he saw inside
the gates a restless, waiting company of dragoons,
ready for the command to ride forth. Worn, haggard
fellows, who had slept but little and who had eaten
scarcely anything for three days; men who would have
starved to death. Now they were forgetting their
hunger and fatigue in the wild, exultant joy of the
prospect ahead.</p>

<p>Meantime, King had crossed the grounds with
Colonel Quinnox, on the way to the Castle. He was
amazed, almost stupefied by the devastation that already
had been wrought. Trees were down; great, gaping
holes in the ground marked the spots where shells had
fallen; the plaza was an almost impassable heap of
masonry and soil, torn and rent by huge projectiles.
But it was his first clear view of the Castle itself that
appalled the American.</p>

<p>A dozen or more balls had crashed into the fa&ccedil;ade.
Yawning fissures, gigantic holes, marked the path of the
ugly messengers from Marlanx. Nearly all of the windows
had been wrecked by riflemen who shot from the
roofs of palaces in and about the avenue. Two of the
smaller minarets were in ruins; a huge pillar in the
lower balcony was gone; the terrace had been ploughed
up by a single ricochetting shell.</p>

<p>&quot;Great God!&quot; gasped King. &quot;It is frightful!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They began bombarding yesterday afternoon. We
were asked to surrender at three o'clock. Our reply
brought the shells, Mr. King. It was terrible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the loss of life, Colonel?&quot; demanded the other
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;After the first two or three shells we found places of
shelter for the Prince and his friends. They are in the
stone tower beyond the Castle, overlooking what still
remains of the ancient moat. Ah, there are no faltering
hearts here, Mr. King. The most glorious courage instead.
Count Vos Engo guards the Prince and the
ladies of the household. Alas! it was hunger that we
feared the most. To-day we should have resorted to
horse's flesh. There was no other way. We knew that relief
would come some day. John Tullis was there. We
had faith in him and in you. And now it is to-day! This
shall be our day, thank God! Nothing can stand before
us!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tullis is very anxious about his sister,&quot; ventured
Truxton. Quinnox looked straight ahead, but smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;She is the pluckiest of them all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is she well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps a trifle thin, sir, that is all. I dare say that
is due to scarcity of nourishment, although the Prince
and his closest associates were the last to feel deprivation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How does the Prince take all this, Colonel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As any Prince of Graustark would, sir. There is no
other way. It is in the blood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor little chap!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will rejoice to know that you have found his lucky
stone so effective. The Prince has never wavered in his
loyalty to that pebble, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Together they entered the Castle. Inside there were
horrid signs of destruction, particularly off the balconies.</p>

<p>&quot;No one occupies the upper part of the Castle now,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Attendants sped to the tower, shouting the battle tidings.
No compunction was felt in arousing the sleeping
household. As a matter of fact, there was no protest
from the eager ladies and gentlemen who hurried forth
to hear the news.</p>

<p>The Prince came tumbling down the narrow iron stairs
from his room above, shouting joyously to Truxton
King. No man was ever so welcome. He was besieged
with questions, handshakings and praises. Even the
Duke of Perse, hobbling on crutches, had a kindly greeting
for him. Tears streamed down the old man's cheeks
when King told him of his daughter's safe arrival in
the friendly camp.</p>

<p>Truxton picked the Prince up in his arms and held him
close to his breast, patting his back all the while, his
heart so full that he could not speak.</p>

<p>&quot;I knowed you'd come back,&quot; Bobby kept crying in
his ear. &quot;Aunt Loraine said you wouldn't, but I said
you would. I knowed it&mdash;I knowed it! And now you're
going to be a baron, sure enough. Isn't he, Uncle
Caspar?&quot;</p>

<p>But Truxton was not listening to the eager prattle.
He remembered afterward that Bobby's hands and face
were hot with fever. Just now he was staring at the
narrow staircase. Vos Engo and Loraine were descending
slowly. The former was white and evidently very
weak. He leaned on the girl for support.</p>

<p>Count Halfont offered the explanation. &quot;Vos Engo
was shot last week, through the shoulder. He is too
brave to give up, as you may see. It happened on the
terrace. There was an unexpected fusilade from the
housetops. Eric placed himself between the marksmen
and Miss Tullis. A bullet that might have killed her
instantly, struck him in the shoulder. They were fleeing
to the balcony. He fell and she dragged him to a place
of safety. The wound is not so serious as it might have
been, but he should be in bed. He, like most of us, has
not removed his clothing in five days and nights.&quot;</p>

<p>King never forgot the look in Loraine's eyes as she came
down the steps. Joy and anguish seemed to combine
themselves in that long, intense look. He saw her hand
go to her heart. Her lips were parted. He knew she
was breathing quickly, tremulously.</p>

<p>The Prince was whispering in his ear: &quot;Keep the lucky
stone, Mr. King. Please keep it. It will surely help
you. I gave her your kiss. She was happy&mdash;awful
happy for awhile. 'Nen the Count he saved her from
the bullet. But you just keep the lucky stone.&quot; King
put him down and walked directly across to meet her
at the foot of the steps.</p>

<p>She gave him her hands. The look in her tired eyes
went straight to his heart. Vos Engo drew back, his
face set in a frown of displeasure.</p>

<p>&quot;My brother?&quot; she asked, without taking her gaze
from his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;He is well. He will see you to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you, Truxton?&quot; was her next question, low and
quavering.</p>

<p>&quot;Unharmed and unchanged, Loraine,&quot; he said softly.
&quot;Tell me, did Vos Engo stand between you and the fire
from the&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Truxton,&quot; she said, dropping her eyes as if in
deep pain.</p>

<p>&quot;And you have not&mdash;broken your promise to him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Nor have I broken my promise to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is a brave man. I can't help saying it,&quot; said the
American, deep lines suddenly appearing in his face.
Swiftly he turned to Vos Engo, extending his hand.
&quot;My hand, sir, to a brave man!&quot;</p>

<p>Vos Engo stared at him for a moment and then turned
away, ignoring the friendly hand. A hot flush mounted
to Loraine's brow.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a brave man, too, Eric,&quot; she said very quietly.</p>

<p>Vos Engo's response was a short, bitter laugh.</p>

<h3>THE LAST STAND</h3>


<p>Soon after five o'clock, a man in the topmost window of
the tower called down that the forces in the hills were
moving in a compact body toward the ridges below the
southern gates.</p>

<p>&quot;Give them half an hour to locate themselves,&quot; advised
Truxton King. &quot;They will move rapidly and strike as
soon as the shells have levelled the gates. The proper
time for your sortie, Colonel, would be some time in
advance of their final movement. You will in that way
draw at least a portion of Marlanx's men away from the
heart of the city. They will come to the assistance of
the gang bivouacked beyond the Duke of Perse's
palace.&quot;</p>

<p>One hundred picked men were to be left inside the
Castle gates with Vos Engo, prepared to meet any
flank movement that might be attempted. Three hundred
mounted men were selected to make the dash down
Castle Avenue, straight into the camp of the sharpshooters.
It was the purpose of the house guard to
wage a fierce and noisy conflict off the Avenue and then
retire to the Castle as abruptly as they left it, to be
ready for Marlanx, should he decide to make a final
desperate effort to seize their stronghold.</p>

<p>King, fired by a rebellious zeal, elected to ride with the
attacking party. His heart was cold with the fear that
he was to lose Loraine, after all. The fairy princess
of his dreams seemed farther away from him than ever.
&quot;I'll do what I can for the Prince,&quot; he said to himself.
&quot;He's a perfect little brick. Damn Vos Engo! I'll
make him repent that insult. Every one noticed it,
too. She tried to smooth it over, but&mdash;oh, well, what's
the use!&quot;</p>

<p>The dash of the three hundred through the gates and
down the avenue was the most spectacular experience in
Truxton's life. He was up with Quinnox and General
Braze, galloping well in front of the yelling troop.
These mounted carbineers, riding as Bedouins, swept
like thunder down the street, whirled into the broad,
open arena beyond the Duke's palace, and were upon
the surprised ruffians before they were fully awake to
the situation.</p>

<p>They came tumbling out of barns and sheds, clutching
their rifles in nerveless hands, aghast in the face of
absolute destruction. It was all over with the first dash
of the dragoons. The enemy, craven at the outset,
threw down their guns and tried to escape through the
alleys and side streets at the end of the common. Firing
all the time, the attacking force rode them down as if
they were so many dogs. The few who stood their
ground and fought valiantly were overpowered and
made captive by Quinnox. Less than a hundred men
were found in the camp. Instead of retreating immediately
to the Castle, Quinnox, acting on the suggestion
of the exhilarated King, kept up a fierce, deceptive
fire for the benefit of the distant Marlanx.</p>

<p>After ten or fifteen minutes of this desultory carnage,
it was reported that a large force of men were entering
the avenue from Regengetz Circus. Quinnox sent his
chargers toward this great horde of foot-soldiers, but
they did not falter as he had expected. On they swept,
two or three thousand of them. At their head rode
five or six officers. The foremost was Count Marlanx.</p>

<p>The cannons were booming now in the foothills.
Marlanx, if he heard them and realised what the bombardment
meant, did not swerve from the purpose at
present in his mind.</p>

<p>Quinnox saw now that the Iron Count was determined
to storm the gates, and gave the command to retreat.
Waving their rifles and shouting defiance over their
shoulders, the dragoons drew up, wheeled and galloped
toward the gates.</p>

<p>Truxton King afterward recalled to mind certain huge
piles of fresh earth in a corner of the common. He did
not know what they meant at the time of observation,
but he was wiser inside of three minutes after the whirlwind
brigade dashed through the gates.</p>

<p>Scarcely were the massive portals closed and the great
steel bars dropped into place by the men who attended
them, when a low, dull explosion shook the earth as if
by volcanic force. Then came the crashing of timbers,
the cracking of masonry, the whirring of a thousand
missiles through the air. Before the very eyes of the
stunned, bewildered defenders, dismounting near the
parade ground, the huge gates and pillars fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>The gates have been dynamited!</p>

<p>Then it was that Truxton King remembered. Marlanx's
sappers had been quietly at work for days, drilling
from the common to the gates. It was a strange
coincidence that Marlanx should have chosen this day
for his culminating assault on the Castle. The skirmish
at daybreak had hurried his arrangements, no doubt,
but none the less were his plans complete. The explosives
had been laid during the night; the fuses
reached to the mouth of the tunnel, across the common.
As he swept up the avenue at the head of his command,
hawk-faced and with glittering eyes, he snarled the
command that put fire to the fuses. He was still a
quarter of a mile away when the gates crumbled. With
short, shrill cries, scarcely human in their viciousness,
he urged his men forward. He and Brutus were the
first to ride up to the great hole that yawned where the
gates had stood. Beyond they could see the distracted
soldiers of the Prince forming in line to resist attack.</p>

<p>A moment later his vanguard streamed through the
aperture and faced the deadly fire from the driveway.</p>

<p>Like a stone wall the men under Quinnox stood their
ground; a solid, defiant line that fired with telling accuracy
into the struggling horde. On the walls two
Gatling guns began to cackle their laugh of death.
And still the mercenaries poured through the gap, forming
in haphazard lines under the direction of the maddened
Iron Count.</p>

<p>At last they began to advance across the grassy
meadow. When one man fell under the fire of the
Guardsmen, another rushed into his place. Three
times the indomitable Graustarkians drove them back,
and as often did Marlanx drag them up again, exalted
by the example he set.</p>

<p>&quot;'Gad, he <i>is</i> a soldier,&quot; cried Truxton, who had wasted
a half dozen shots in the effort to bring him down.
&quot;Hello! There's my friend Brutus. He's no coward,
either. Here's a try for you, Brutus.&quot;</p>

<p>He dropped to his knee and took deliberate aim at the
frenzied henchman. The discovery that there were three
bullets in Brutus's breast when he was picked up long
afterward did not affect the young man's contention
that his was the one that had found the heart.</p>

<p>The fall of Brutus urged the Iron Count to greater
fury. His horse had been shot from under him. He
was on his feet, a gaunt demon, his back to the enemy,
calling to his men to follow him as he moved toward
the stubborn row of green and red. Bullets hissed about
his ears, but he gave no heed to them. More than one
man in the opposing force watched him as if fascinated.
He seemed to be absolutely bullet-proof. There were
times when he stumbled and almost fell over the bodies
of his own men lying in the path.</p>

<p>By this time his entire force was inside the grounds.
Colonel Quinnox was quick to see the spreading movement
on the extreme right and left. Marlanx's captains
were trained warriors. They were bent on flanking
the enemy. The commander of the Guard gave the
command to fall back slowly toward the Castle.</p>

<p>Firing at every step, they crossed the parade ground
and then made a quick dash for the shelter of the long
balconies. They held this position for nearly an hour,
resisting each succeeding charge of the now devilish
foe. Time and again the foremost of the attacking
party reached the terrace, only to wither under the
deadly fire from behind the balustrades. Marlanx,
down in the parade ground, was fairly pushing his men
into the jaws of death. There was no question as to the
courage of the men he commanded. These were not the
ruffians from all over the world. They were the reckless,
devil-may-care mountaineers and robbers from the
hills of Graustark itself.</p>

<p>Truxton King's chance to pay his debt to Vos Engo
came after one of the fiercest, most determined charges.
The young Count, who had transferred his charges
from the old tower to the strong north wing of the
Castle, had been fighting desperately in the front rank
for some time. His weakness seemed to have disappeared
entirely. As the foe fell back in the face of
the desperate resistance, Vos Engo sprang down the
steps and rushed after them, calling others to join him
in the attempt to complete the rout. Near the edge of
the terrace he stopped. His leg gave way under him
and he fell to the ground. Truxton saw him fall.</p>

<p>He leaped over the low balustrade, dropping his hot
rifle, and dashed across the terrace to his rival's
assistance. A hundred men shot at him. Vos Engo was
trying to get to his feet, his hand upon his thigh; he
was groaning with pain.</p>

<p>&quot;It's my turn,&quot; shouted the American. &quot;I'll square
it up if I can. Then we're even!&quot;</p>

<p>He seized the wounded man in his strong arms, threw
him over his shoulder and staggered toward the steps.</p>

<p>&quot;Release me, damn you!&quot; shrieked Vos Engo, striking
his rescuer in the face with his fist.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm saving you for another day,&quot; said King as he
dropped behind the balustrade, with his burden safe.
A wild cheer went up from the lips of the defenders,
scornful howls from the enemy.</p>

<p>&quot;I pray God it may be deferred until I am capable of
defending myself,&quot; groaned Vos Engo, glaring at the
other with implacable hatred in his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;You might pray for my preservation, too, while
you're at it,&quot; said Truxton, as he crept away to regain
his rifle.</p>

<p>There were other witnesses to Truxton's rash act. In
a lofty window of the north wing crouched a white-
faced girl and a grim old man. The latter held a rifle
in his tense though feeble hands. They had been there
for ten minutes or longer, watching the battle from
their eerie place of security. Now and then the old
man would sight his rifle and fire. A groan of anger
and dismay escaped his lips after each attempt to send
his bullet to the spot intended. The girl who crouched
beside him was there to designate a certain figure in the
ever-changing mass of humanity on the bloody parade
ground. Her clear eyes sought for and found Marlanx;
her unwavering finger pointed him out to the old marksman.</p>

<p>She saw Vos Engo fall. Then a tall, well-known figure
sprang into view, dashing toward her wounded lover.
Her heart stopped beating. The blood rushed to her
eyes. Everything before her turned red&mdash;a horrid,
blurring red. With her hands to her temples, she leaned
far over the window ledge and screamed&mdash;screamed
words that would have filled Truxton King with an endless
joy could he have heard them above the rattle of
the rifles.</p>

<p>&quot;A brave act!&quot; exclaimed the old man at her side.
&quot;Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p>But she did not hear him. She had fallen back and was
gasping supplication, her eyes set upon the old man's
face with a stare that meant nothing.</p>

<p>The corner of the building had shut out the picture;
it was impossible for her to know that the man and his
burden had reached the balcony in safety. Even now,
they might be lying on the terrace, riddled by bullets.
The concentrated aim of the enemy had not escaped
her horrified gaze. The cheering did not reach her ears.</p>

<p>The old man roused her from the stupor of dread. He
called her name several times in high, strident tones.
Dully she responded. Standing bolt upright in the
window she sought out the figure of Marlanx, and
pointed rigidly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; groaned the old man, &quot;they will not be driven
back this time! They will not be denied. It is the last
charge! God, how they come! Our men will be annihilated
in&mdash;Where is he? Now! Ah, I see! Yes,
that is he! He is near enough now. I cannot miss
him!&quot;</p>

<p>Marlanx was leading his men up to the terrace. A
howling avalanche of humanity, half obscured by
smoke, streamed up the slope.</p>

<p>At the top of the terrace, the Iron Count suddenly
stopped. His long body stiffened and then crumpled
like a reed. A score of heavy feet trampled on the
fallen leader, but he did not feel the impact.</p>

<p>A bullet from the north wing had crashed into his
brain.</p>

<p>&quot;At last!&quot; shrieked the old man at the window. &quot;Come,
Miss Tullis; my work is done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is dead, your Grace?&quot; in low, awed tones.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear,&quot; said the Duke of Perse, a smile of
relief on his face. &quot;Come, let me escort you to the
Prince. You have been most courageous. Graustark
shall not forget it. Nor shall I ever cease thanking
you for the service you have rendered to me. I have
succeeded in freeing my unhappy daughter from the
vile beast to whom I sold her youth and beauty and
purity. Come! You must not look upon that carnage!&quot;</p>

<p>Together they left the little room. As they stepped
into the narrow hall beyond they realised that the defenders
had been driven inside the walls of the Castle.
The crash of firearms filled the halls far below; a
deafening, steady roar came up to them.</p>

<p>&quot;It is all over,&quot; said the Duke of Perse, hobbling across
the hall and throwing open the door to a room opposite.</p>

<p>A group of terrified women were huddled in the far
corner of the spacious room. In front of them was the
little Prince, a look of terror in his eyes, but with the
tiny sword clutched in his hand&mdash;a pathetic figure of
courage and dread combined. The Duke of Perse held
open the door for Loraine Tullis, but she did not enter.
When he turned to call, she was half way down the top
flight of stairs, racing through the powder smoke toward
the landing below.</p>

<p>At every step she was screaming in the very agony of
gladness:</p>

<p>&quot;Stand firm! Hold them! Help is coming! Help
is coming!&quot;</p>

<p>A last look through the window at the end of the hail
had revealed to her the most glorious of visions.</p>

<p>Red and green troops were pouring through the dismantled
gateway, their horses surging over the ugly
ground-rifts and debris as if possessed of the fabled
wings.</p>

<p>She had seen the rear line in the storming forces
hesitate and then turn to meet the whirlwind charge
of the cavalrymen. Her brother was out there and all
was well. She was crying the joyous news from the
head of the grand stairway when Truxton King caught
sight of her.</p>

<p>Smoke writhed about her slim, inspiriting figure. Her
face shone through the drab fog like an undimmed star
of purest light. He bounded up the steps toward her,
drawn as by magnet against which there was no such
thing as resistance.</p>

<p>He was powder-stained and grimy; there was blood
on his face and shirt front.</p>

<p>&quot;You are shot,&quot; she cried, clutching the post at the
bend in the stairs. &quot;Truxton! Truxton!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not even scratched,&quot; he shouted, as he reached her
side. &quot;It's not my&mdash;&quot; He stopped short, even as he
held out his arms to clasp her to his breast. &quot;It's some
one else's blood,&quot; he finished resolutely. She swayed
toward him and he caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you&mdash;oh, I love you, Truxton!&quot; she cried over
and over again. He was faint with joy. His kisses
spoke the adoration he would have cried out to her if
emotion had not clogged his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;Eric?&quot; she whispered at last, drawing back in his
arms and looking up into his eyes with a great pity in
her own. &quot;Is he&mdash;is he dead, Truxton?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said gently. &quot;Badly hurt, but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will not die? Thank God, Truxton. He is a
brave&mdash;oh, a very brave man.&quot; Then she remembered
her mission into this whirlpool of danger. &quot;Go! Don't
lose a moment, darling! Tell Colonel Quinnox that
Jack has come! The dragoons are&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>He did not hear the end of her cry. A quick, fierce
kiss and he was gone, bounding down the stairs with
great shouts of encouragement.</p>

<p>Leaderless, between the deadly fires, the mercenaries
gave up the fight after a brief stand at the terrace.
Six hundred horsemen ploughed through them, driving
them to the very walls of the Castle. Here they broke
and scattered, throwing down their arms and shouting
for mercy. It was all over inside of twenty minutes.</p>

<p>The Prince reigned again.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Nightfall brought complete restoration of order,
peace and security in the city of Edelweiss. Hundreds
of lives had been lost in the terrific conflict of the early
morning hours; hundreds of men lay on beds of suffering,
crushed and bleeding from the wounds they had
courted and received.</p>

<p>&quot;I knowed we'd whip them,&quot; shouted the Prince, wriggling
gleefully in John Tullis's straining embrace half
an hour after the latter had ridden through the gate.
Tears streamed down the big man's face. One arm
held the boy, the other encircled the sister he had all
but lost. In the Monastery of St. Valentine there was
another woman, waiting for him to come to her with
the news of a glorious victory. Perhaps she was hoping
and praying for the other news that he would bring her,
who knows? If he came to her with kisses, she would
know without being told in so many words.</p>

<p>Truxton did not again see Loraine until late in the
afternoon. He had offered his services to Colonel
Quinnox and had worked manfully in the effort to
provide comfort for the wounded of both sides. General
Braze was at work with his men in the open city, clearing
away the ugly signs of battle. The fortress and
Tower were full of the prisoners of war. Baron
Dangloss, pale, emaciated, sick but resolute, was free
once more and, with indomitable zeal, had thrown himself
and his liberated men at once into the work of rehabilitation.</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of the Baron's first visit to the
Prince, late in the day, that Truxton saw the girl he
worshipped.</p>

<p>Prince Robin had sent for him to appear in the devastated
state chamber. Publicly, in the presence of
the Court and Ministry, the little ruler proclaimed him
a baron and presented to him a great seal ring from
among the ancient crown jewels.</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Mr. King,&quot; said Bobby, after he had called the
American quite close to him by means of a stealthy
crooking of his finger, &quot;would you mind giving me my
lucky stone? I don't think you'll need it any longer.
I will, I'm sure. You see a prince has such a lot of
things to trouble him. Wars and murders and everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Prince Robin,&quot; said King, placing the
stone in the little hand. &quot;I couldn't have got on without
it. May it always serve you as well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Noblesse oblige, Baron,&quot; said Prince Robin gravely.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; in an excited whisper. &quot;Here's Baron
Dangloss. He's been in his own gaol!&quot;</p>

<p>Truxton withdrew. Near the door he met Loraine.
She had just entered the room. There was a bright
look of relief in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Count Vos Engo has asked for you, Truxton,&quot; she
said in a low voice. A delicate flush crept into her
cheeks; a sudden shyness leaped into her eyes, and she
looked away.</p>

<p>&quot;Loraine, have you told him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I am so sorry for him. He is one of the
bravest men I have ever known, Truxton dear. And,
as it is with all men of his race, love knew no reason,
no compromise. But I have made him see that I&mdash;that I
cannot be his wife. He knows that I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Somehow, darling, I'm sorry for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He will not pretend friendship for you, dear,&quot; she
went on painfully. &quot;He only wants to thank you and
to apologise, as you did, not so long ago. And he
wants to ask you to release him from a certain obligation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean our&mdash;our fight?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. He is to lose his right arm, Truxton. You
understand how it is with him now.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII" />CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>&quot;YOU WILL BE MRS. KING&quot;</h3>


<p>Late that night it was reported at the Castle that a
large force of men were encamped on the opposite side
of the river. A hundred camp-fires were gleaming
against the distant uplands.</p>

<p>&quot;The Grand Duke Paulus!&quot; exclaimed Count Halfont.
&quot;Thank God, he did not come a day earlier. We owe
him nothing to-day&mdash;but yesterday! Ah, he could have
demanded much of us. Send his messengers to me,
Colonel Quinnox, as soon as they arrive in the morning.
I will arise early. There is much to do in Graustark.
Let there be no sluggards.&quot;</p>

<p>A mellow, smiling moon crept up over the hills, flooding
the laud with a serene radiance. Once more the
windows in the Castle gleamed brightly; low-voiced
people strolled through the shattered balconies; others
wandered about the vast halls, possessed by uncertain
emotions, torn by the conflicting hands of joy and
gloom. In a score of rooms wounded men were lying; in
others there were dead heroes. At the barracks, standing
dully against the distant shadows, there were many
cots of suffering. And yet there was rejoicing, even
among those who writhed in pain or bowed their heads
in grief. Victory's wings were fanning the gloom away;
conquest was painting an ever-widening streak of
brightness across the dark, drear canvas of despair.</p>

<p>In one of the wrecked approaches to the terrace,
surrounded by fragments of stone and confronted by
ugly destruction, sat a young man and a slender girl.
There were no lights near them; the shadows were black
and forbidding. This particular end of the terrace
had suffered most in the fierce rain of cannon-balls.
So great was the devastation here that one attained the
position held by the couple only by means of no little
daring and at the risk of unkind falls. From where
they sat they could see the long vista of lighted windows
and yet could not themselves be seen.</p>

<p>His arm was about her; her head nestled securely
against his shoulder and her slim hands were willing
prisoners in one of his.</p>

<p>She was saying &quot;Truxton, dear, I did <i>not</i> love Eric
Vos Engo. I just thought it was love. I never really
knew what love is until you came into my life. Then I
knew the difference. That's what made it so hard. I
had let him believe that I might care for him some day.
And I <i>did</i> like him. So I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are sure&mdash;terribly sure&mdash;that I am the only man
you ever really loved?&quot; he interrupted.</p>

<p>She snuggled closer. &quot;Haven't I just told you that I
didn't know what it was until&mdash;well, until now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will never, never know how happy I am,
Loraine!&quot; he breathed into her ear.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I shall always bring happiness to you, Truxton,&quot;
she murmured, faint with the joy of loving.</p>

<p>&quot;You will make me very unhappy if you don't marry
me to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I couldn't think of it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't ask you to think. If you do, you may
change your mind completely. Just marry me without
thinking, dearest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will marry you, Truxton, when we get to New
York,&quot; she said, but not very firmly. He saw his advantage.</p>

<p>&quot;But, my dear, I'm tired of travelling.&quot;</p>

<p>It was rather enigmatic. &quot;What has that to do with
it?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's this way: if we get married in New York
we'll have to consider an extended and wholly obligatory
wedding journey. If we get married here, we can save
all that bother by bridal-tripping to New York, instead
of away from it. And, what's more, we'll escape the
rice-throwing and the old shoes and the hand-painted
trunk labels. Greater still: we will avoid a long and
lonely trip across the ocean on separate steamers. That's
something, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We <i>could</i> go on the same steamer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite so, my dear. But don't you think it would be
nicer if we went as one instead of two?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose it would be cheaper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They say a fellow saves money by getting married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hate a man who is always trying to save money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you put it that way, I'll promise never to
save a cent. I'm a horrible spendthrift.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you'll have to save, Truxton!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How silly we are!&quot; he cried in utter joyousness. He
held her close for a long time, his face buried in her
hair. &quot;Listen, darling: won't you say you'll be my
wife before I leave Graustark? I want you so much.
I can't go away without you.&quot;</p>

<p>She hesitated. &quot;When are you going, Truxton? You&mdash;you
haven't told me.&quot;</p>

<p>It was what he wanted. &quot;I am going next Monday,&quot;
he said promptly. As a matter of fact, he had forgotten
the day of the week they were now living in.</p>

<p>&quot;Monday? Oh, dear!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;I must cable home first,&quot; she faltered.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a mere detail, darling. Cable afterward. It
will beat us home by three weeks. They'll know we're
coming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I must ask John, really I must, Truxton,&quot; she protested
faintly.</p>

<p>&quot;Hurray!&quot; he shouted&mdash;in a whisper. &quot;He is so
desperately in love, he won't think of refusing anything
we ask. Shall we set it for Saturday?&quot;</p>

<p>They set it for Saturday without consulting John
Tullis, and then fell to discussing him. &quot;He is very
much in love with her,&quot; she said wistfully.</p>

<p>&quot;And she loves him, Loraine. They will be very happy.
She's wonderful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, so is John. He's the most wonderful man in
all this world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am sure of it,&quot; he agreed magnanimously. &quot;I saw
him talking with her and the Duke of Perse as I came
out awhile ago. They were going to the Duke's rooms
up there. The Duke will offer no objections. I think
he'll permit his daughter to select his next son-in-law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How could he have given her to that terrible, terrible
old man?&quot; she cried, with a shudder.</p>

<p>&quot;She won't be in mourning for him long, I fancy.
Nobody will talk of appearances, either. She could
marry Jack to-morrow and no one would criticise her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that would be disgusting, Truxton!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, my dear, he isn't to have a funeral, so why not?
They buried his body in quicklime this afternoon. No
mourners, no friends, no tears! Hang it all, she's
foolish if she puts on anything but red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They can't be married for&mdash;oh, ever so long,&quot; she
said very primly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; he said with alacrity. But he did not
believe what he said. If he knew anything about John
Tullis, it would not be &quot;ever so long&quot; before Prince
Robin's friend turned Benedict and husband to the most
noted beauty in all Graustark.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be sorry to leave Graustark,&quot; she said dreamily,
after a long period of silent retrospection. &quot;I've
had the happiest year of my life here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've had the busiest month of my life here. I'll never
again say that the world is a dull place. And I'll
never advise any man to go out of his own home city
in search of the most adorable woman in the world. She's
always there, bless her heart, if he'll only look around
a bit for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you wouldn't have found me if you hadn't come
to Graustark.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shudder when I think of what might have happened
to you, my Princess Sweetheart, if I hadn't come to
Edelweiss. No; I would not have found you.&quot; Feeling
her tremble in his arms, he went on with whimsical good
humour: &quot;You would have been eaten up by the ogre
long before this. Or, perhaps, you would have succeeded
in becoming a countess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As it is, I shall be a baroness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In Graustark, but not in New York. That reminds
me. You'll be more than a baroness&mdash;more than a
princess. You will be a queen. Don't you catch the
point? You will be Mrs. King.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Grand Duke Paulus was distinctly annoyed. He
had travelled many miles, endured quite a number of
hardships, and all to no purpose. When dawn came,
his emissaries returned from the city with the lamentable
information that the government had righted itself,
that Marlanx's sensational revolution was at an
end, and that the regents would be highly honoured if
his Excellency could overlook the distressingly chaotic
conditions at court and condescend to pay the Castle a
visit. The regents, the Prince and the citizens of Graustark
desired the opportunity to express their gratitude
for the manner in which he had voluntarily (and unexpectedly)
come to their assistance in time of trouble.
The fact that he had come too late to render the invaluable
aid he so nobly intended did not in the least
minimise the volume of gratefulness they felt.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke admitted that he was at sea, diplomatically.
He was a fifth wheel, so to speak, now that
the revolution was over. Not so much as the tip of
his finger had he been able to get into the coveted pie.
There was nothing for him to do but to turn round with
his five thousand Cossacks and march disconsolately
across the steppes to an Imperial railroad, where he
could embark for home. However, he would visit the
Castle in a very informal way, extend his congratulations,
offer his services&mdash;which he knew would be declined
with thanks&mdash;and profess his unbounded joy in
the discovery that Graustark happily was so able to
take care of herself. Incidentally, he would mention
the bond issue; also, he would find the opportunity to
suggest to the ministry that his government still was
willing to make large grants and stupendous promises
if any sort of an arrangement could be made by which
the system might be operated in conjunction with
branch lines of the Imperial roads.</p>

<p>And so it was that at noon he rode in pomp and
splendour through the city gates, attended by his staff
and a rather overpowering body-guard. His excuse
for the early call was delicately worded. He said in
his reply to the message from the Count that it would
give him great pleasure to remain for some time at the
Castle, were it not for the fact that he had left his own
province in a serious state of unrest; it was imperative
that he should return in advance of the ever-possible
and always popular uprising. Therefore he would pay
his respects to his serene Highness, renew his protestations
of friendship, extend his felicitations, and beg
leave to depart for his own land without delay.</p>

<p>As he rode from Regengetz Circus into Castle Avenue,
a small knot of American tourists crowded to the curb
and bent eager, attentive ears to the words of a stubby
little person whom we should recognise by his accent;
but, for fear that there may be some who have forgotten
him in the rush of events, we will point to his
cap and read aloud: &quot;Cook's Interpreter.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Hobbs was saying: &quot;The gentleman on the gray
horse, ladies and gentlemen, is his <i>Highness</i>, the Grand
Duke Paulus. He has come to pay his respects to his
Serene Highness. Now, if you will kindly step this
way, I will show you the spot where the bomb was
thrown. 'Aving been an eye-witness to the shocking
occurrence, I respectfully submit that I,&quot; etc. With
a pride and dignity that surpassed all moderate sense
of appreciation, he delivered newly made history unto
his charges, modestly winding up his discourse with the
casual remark that the Prince had but recently appointed
him twelfth assistant steward at the Castle,
and that he expected to assume the duties of this
honorary position just as soon as Cook &amp; Sons could
find a capable man to send up in his place.</p>

<p>The American tourists, it may be well to observe, arrived
by the first train that entered the city from the
outside world.</p>

<p>The audience was at two o'clock. Prince Robin was
in a state of tremendous excitement. Never before had
he been called upon to receive a grand duke. He quite
forgot yesterday's battle in the face of this most imposing
calamity. More than that, he was in no frame
of mind to enjoy the excitement attending the rehabilitation
of the Castle; oppressed by the approaching
shadow of the great man, he lost all interest in what was
going on in the Castle, about the grounds and among
his courtiers.</p>

<p>&quot;What'll I do, Uncle Jack, if he asks any questions?&quot;
he mourned. They were dressing him in the robes of
state.</p>

<p>&quot;Answer 'em,&quot; said his best friend.</p>

<p>&quot;But supposin' I can't? Then what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He won't ask questions, Bobby. People never
do when a potentate is on his throne. It's shockingly
bad form.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope he won't stay long,&quot; prayed Bobby, a grave
pucker between his brows. He was a very tired little
boy. His eyes were heavy with sleep and his lips were
not very firm.</p>

<p>&quot;Count Halfont will look after him, Bobby; so don't
worry. Just sit up there on the throne and look wise.
The regents will do the rest. Watch your Uncle Caspar.
When he gives the signal, you arise. That ends the
audience. You walk out&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know all about that, Uncle Jack. But I bet I do
something wrong. This thing of receiving grand
dukes is no joke. 'Specially when we're so terribly upset.
Really, I ought to be looking after the men who
are wounded, attending to the funerals of&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Bobby, don't flunk like that! Be a man!&quot;</p>

<p>Bobby promptly squared his little shoulders and set
his jaw. &quot;Oh, I'm not scared!&quot; He was thoughtful
for a moment. &quot;But, I'll tell you, it's awful lonesome
up in that big chair, so far away from all your friends.
I wish Uncle Caspar would let me sit down with the
crowd.&quot;</p>

<p>The Grand Duke, with all the arrogance of a real
personage, was late. It was not for him to consider the
conditions that distressed the Court of Graustark. Not
at all. He was a grand duke and he would take his
own time in paying his respects. What cared he that
every one in the Castle was tired and unstrung and sad
and&mdash;sleepy? Any one but a grand duke would have
waited a day or two before requiring a royal audience.
When he finally presented himself at the Castle doors,
a sleepy group of attendants actually yawned in his
presence.</p>

<p>A somnolent atmosphere, still touched by the smell of
gunpowder, greeted him as he strode majestically down
the halls. Somehow each person who bowed to him
seemed to do it with the melancholy precision of one
who has been up for six nights in succession and doesn't
care who knows it.</p>

<p>No one had slept during the night just passed. Excitement
and the suffering of others had denied slumber
to one and all&mdash;even to those who had not slept for
many days and nights. Now the reaction was upon
them. Relaxation had succeeded tenseness.</p>

<p>When the Grand Duke entered the great, sombre
throne room, he was confronted by a punctiliously
polite assemblage, but every eyelid was as heavy as lead
and as prone to sink.</p>

<p>The Prince sat far back in the great chair of his
ancestors, his sturdy legs sticking straight out in front
of him, utterly lost in the depths of gold and royal
velvet. Two-score or more of his courtiers and as
many noble ladies of the realm stood soberly in the
places assigned them by the laws of precedence. The
Grand Duke advanced between the respectful lines and
knelt at the foot of the throne.</p>

<p>&quot;Arise, your Highness,&quot; piped Bobby, with a quick
glance at Count Halfont. It was a very faint, faraway
voice that uttered the gracious command. &quot;Graustark
welcomes the Grand Duke Paulus. It is my pleasure to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&quot;
a helpless look came into his eyes. He
looked everywhere for support. The Grand Duke saw
that he had forgotten the rehearsed speech, and smiled
benignly as he stepped forward and kissed the hand that
had been extended somewhat uncertainly.</p>

<p>&quot;My most respectful homage to your Majesty. The
felicitations of my emperor and the warmest protestations
of friendship from his people.&quot;</p>

<p>With this as a prologue, he engaged himself in the
ever-pleasurable task of delivering a long, congratulatory
address. If there was one thing above another that
the Grand Duke enjoyed, it was the making of a speech.
He prided himself on his prowess as an orator and as an
after-dinner speaker; but, more than either of these,
he gloried in his ability to soar extemporaneously.</p>

<p>For ten minutes he addressed himself to the throne,
benignly, comfortably. Then he condescended to devote
a share of his precious store to the courtiers behind
him. If he caught more than one of them yawning
when he turned in their direction, he did not permit
it to disturb him in the least. His eyes may have narrowed
a bit, but that was all.</p>

<p>After five minutes of high-sounding platitudes, he
again turned to the Prince. It was then that he received
his first shock.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<br />

<a href="images/p366.jpg">
<img src="images/p366.jpg" width="45%" alt="" title="" /></a><br />
<b>&quot;His Majesty appears to have&mdash;ahem&mdash;gone to sleep,&quot;
remarked the Grand Duke tartly&quot;</b><br />
<br />
</div>

<p>Prince Robin was sound asleep. His head was slipping
side-wise along the satiny back of the big chair, and
his chin was very low in the laces at his neck. The
Grand Duke coughed emphatically, cleared his throat,
and grew very red in the face.</p>

<p>The Court of Graustark was distinctly dismayed.
Here was shocking state of affairs. The prince
going to sleep while a grand duke talked!</p>

<p>&quot;His Majesty appears to have&mdash;ahem&mdash;gone to sleep,&quot;
remarked the Grand Duke tartly, interrupting himself
to address the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>&quot;He is very tired, your Excellency,&quot; said Count
Halfont, very much distressed. &quot;Pray consider what
he has been through during the&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my dear Count, do not apologise for him. I
quite understand. Ahem! Ahem!&quot; Still he was very
red in the face. Some one had laughed softly behind
his back.</p>

<p>&quot;I will awaken him, your Excellency,&quot; said the Prime
Minister, edging toward the throne.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all, sir!&quot; protested the visitor. &quot;Permit him
to have his sleep out, sir. I will not have him disturbed.
Who am I that I should defeat the claims of nature? It
is my pleasure to wait until his Majesty's nap is over.
Then he may dismiss us, but not until we have cried:
'Long live the Prince!'&quot;</p>

<p>For awhile they stood in awkward silence, this notable
gathering of men and women. Then the Prime Minister,
in hushed tones, suggested that it would be eminently
proper, under the circumstances, for all present to be
seated. He was under the impression that His Serene
Highness would sleep long and soundly.</p>

<p>Stiff-backed and uncomfortable, the Court sat and
waited. No one pretended to conceal the blissful yawns
that would not be denied. A drowsy, ineffably languid
feeling took possession of the entire assemblage. Here
and there a noble head nodded slightly; eyelids fell in
the silent war against the god of slumber, only to
revive again with painful energy and ever-weakening
courage.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister sat at the foot of the throne and
nodded in spite of himself. The Minister of the
Treasury was breathing so heavily that his neighbor
nudged him just in time to prevent something even more
humiliating. John Tullis, far back near the wall, had
his head on his hand, bravely fighting off the persistent
demon. Prince Dantan of Dawsbergen was sound
asleep.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke was wide awake. He saw it all and
was equal to the occasion. After all, he was a kindly
old gentleman, and, once his moment of mortification
was over, he was not above charity.</p>

<p>Bobby's poor little head had slipped over to a most
uncomfortable position against the arm of the chair.
Putting his finger to his lips, the Grand Duke tip-toed
carefully up to the throne. With very gentle hands he
lifted Bobby's head, and, infinitely tender, stuffed a
throne cushion behind the curly head. Still with his
finger to his lips, a splendid smile in his eyes, he tip-toed
back to his chair.</p>

<p>As he passed Count Halfont, who had risen, he
whispered:</p>

<p>&quot;Dear little man! I do not forget, my lord, that I
was once a boy. God bless him!&quot;</p>

<p>Then he sat down, conscious of a fine feeling of goodness,
folded his arms across his expansive chest, and
allowed his beaming eyes to rest upon the sleeping boy
far back in the chair of state. Incidentally, he decided
to delay a few days before taking up the bond question
with the ministry. The Grand Duke was not an ordinary
diplomat.</p>

<p>In one of the curtained windows, far removed from the
throne, sat Truxton King and Loraine Tullis.</p>

<p>All about them people were watching the delicate little
scene, smiling drowsily at the Grand Duke's tender
comedy. No one was looking at the two in the curtained
recess. Her hand was in his, her head sank slowly
toward his inviting shoulder; her heavy lids drooped
lower and lower, refusing to obey the slender will that
argued against complete surrender. At last her soft,
regular breathing told him that she was asleep. Awaiting
his opportunity, he tenderly kissed the soft, brown
hair, murmured a gentle word of love, and settled his
own head against the thick cushions.</p>

<p>Everywhere they dozed and nodded. The Grand Duke
smiled and blinked his little eyes. He was very wide
awake.</p>

<p>That is how he happened to see the Prince move restlessly
and half open his sleep-bound eyes. The Grand
Duke leaned forward with his hand to his ear, and
listened. He had seen the boy's lips move. From
dreamland came Bobby's belated:</p>

<p>&quot;Good-ni&mdash;ight.&quot;</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
